Vista Geral sobre Ańalise de sentimentos
****************************************

Introdução
^^^^^^^^^^

Analise de sentimentos é útil para uma variedade de problemas que são de interesse de pesquisadores na interação humano-computador. Assim como aqueles dos campos da sociologia, propaganda e marketing, psicologia, economia e politica sociais. (Vader_)

Analise de sentimentos ou mineração de opnião é uma área ativa no campo de processamento de linguagem natural que analiza a opnião, os sentimentos, as atitudes e as emoções das pessoas a partir do tratamento computacional da subjetividade do texto. (Vader_)

Centenas de milhares de pessoas entorno do glovo ativamente usam websites de microbloggin como o Twitter. Desta forma há um enorme interesse na análise de sentimentos do Twitter, em diversas áreas como comercio, saúde e prevenção de desastres. (NRCcanada_)

Em um mundo onde milhões de pessoas expressão suas opniões sobre produtos comerciais em blogs, forums, chats e redes sociais, o entendimento deste conhecimento apartir de informação não estruturada pode ser um fator-chave para o pessoas ligadas a marketing de seus produtos e marcas. A analise automatica destas opiniões no entanto envolve um conhecimento profundo da linguagem natural nos textos por máquinas, o que por enquanto está muito longe do ideal. Os algoritmos responsáveis pela recuperação da informação online são muito bons em recuperar textos, dividi-los me partes, checar orografia, contar palavras, mas quando o assunto é interpretar as sentenças e extrair informação util dos usuários, suas capacidades são bastante limitadas. (Senticcomputing_)

O senso comum é um conhecimento normalmente adquirido no inicio de nossas vidas e faz nós humanos entender todo o aspecitato social, politico, econômico e ambiental em que a sociedade se encontra. Jás as máquinas, nunca tiveram a chance de viver uma vida e desta forma não possuem senso comum e não sabem nada sobre nós. Para nos ajudar em algum trabalho, computadores precisam saber como fazer este trabalho, no caso da análise de sentimentos o computador precisa enterder os humanos e pensar como nós. Hoje de fato as máquinas somente fazem o que são programadas para fazer, possuindo apenas uma forma de se lidar com determinados problemas e se algo está fora do comum elas simplesmente travam. Infelizmente hoje, as máquinas não possuem um objetivo próprio, não possuem esperança e nem medo, desta forma não sabem o real sentido das coisas como os humanos.

Motivação
^^^^^^^^^

Opnião possui um papel decisivo no processo de tomada de decisão. Toda vez que uma pessoa precisa realizar uma escolha, eles estão interessados em saver as opniões dos outros. Quando esta escolha envolve recursos valiosos (gasto de dinheiro ou tempo para comprar produtos ou serviço ), em particular, as pessoas se baseiam fortemente nas experiências passadas pelos seus proximos. A pouco tempo atras, a maior fonte de coleta deste tipo de informação eram os amigos, em familiares, ou em alguns casos, revistas especializadas e sites. Com o adivento da Web disponibilizou as pessoas outras fontes de informações como blogs, midias sociais, serviçoes de compartilhamento de conteudo, que permite criar e compartilhar, em tempo e custo eficiente, seus proprios conteudos, ideias e opniões, com virutalmente milhões de pessoas conectadas na Internet. Com isto ficou disponível a partir de um click, um oceano de informação e opnião, providenciando um meio de comunicação poderoso para compartilhar conhecimento e tomar vantagem a partir das experiencias dos outros.

Atualmente, mais de 75.000 novos blogs são criados diariamente, juntos com 1.2 milhões de novos posts a cada dia, e mais e mais pessoas na sociedade contemporanea baseiamse, nas opniões, nos reviews, e nas recomendações coletadas destes websites. A Web tornou disponivel a opnião de uma vasta gama de pessoas intimas ou críticas de profissionais bem conhecidos. Pessoas, de fato não somente tendem a ouvir a opnião dos outros, como tambem naturalmente dão sua opnião. Usuários na Web normalmente ficam felizes em compartilhar suas opniões relacionados ao mundo real seja negativa ou positiva, por diferentes razões. Possívelmente pelo fato deles se beneficiarem dos reviews online, eles quererem entregar de volta comunidade sua participação, com um senso de união ou mesmo para para das suporte a algum produto em especifico.

Simililarmente a opnião dos usuarios podem ser usadas em emails, ou outro tipo de comunicaçõa para detextar e excluir "flames" como utilizado em sistemas anti-spam. Além disso, sistemas onlines que apresentam propaganda em partes dos sites, podem usar técnicas de mineração de opnião para detectar páginas sensiveis e inapropriadas para determinado tipo de propaganda. A inteligência de negocios é também um dos fatores principais para o interesse de companias na anlise de sentimentos. Hoje em dia, companhias investem mais e mais dinheiro em estratefias de marketing e estão constantemente interessadas tanto na coleta como na previsão de opniões e atitudes fo publico geral em relação a seus produtos e marcas. A criação de ferramentas automaticas capazes de buscar reviews e opniões pela Web em tempo real, e o desenvolvimento representações condensadas destas análises é uma das areas de pesquisas mais ativas. Diversas companhias, de fato, já providencial ferramentas para acompanhar o ponto de vista publico em larga escala oferencendo representações graficas das tendencias e opniões na Blogosfera. O desenvolvimento deste tipo de sistemas, cada vez mais, é não so importante comercialmente, como também importante para inteligencia do estado em aplicações capazes de monitorar opniões hostis e negativas do publico. Todas essas ferramentas, contudo, estão são basicamente baseadas em palavras chaves, e assim normalmente falham, ao ser comparadas a classificaçãp humana. É fundamental ir além destas abordagens desenvolvendo bases de conhecimento capazes de estabelecer conexões cognitivas e afetivas entre o mundo dos homens e o mundo das máquinas.

..	Opinions play a primary role in decision-making processes. Whenever people need to make a choice, they are interested in hearing others opinions. When this choice involves consuming valuable resources (e.g., spending time and money to buy products or services), in particular, people strongly rely on their peers’ past experiences. Just a few years ago, the main sources for collecting such information were friends,acquaintances and, in some cases, specialised magazine or websites. The advent of Web 2.0 has provided people with new tools, e.g., forums, blogs, social networks, and content sharing services, that allow them to create and share, in a time and cost efficient way, their own contents, ideas, and opinions with virtually the millions of people connected to the World Wide Web. This has made available by click a new and oceanic source of information and opinions and has provided a powerful communication medium to share knowledge and to get advantage from others experiences [153].


..	Currently, over 75,000 new blogs are created daily, along with 1.2 million new posts each day, and more and more people in the modern world rely on opinions, reviews, and recommendations collected from these and related websites. The Web has made available the opinions of a vast pool of people that are neither our personal acquaintances nor well-known professional critics. People, in fact, are not just naturally keen on listening to others’ advice, but also naturally inclined to give others advice. Web users are often happy to share both their positive and negative real world experiences for different reasons, e.g., because they benefited from others reviews and want to give back to the community, because they seek for a sense of togetherness in adversity, for cathartic complaining, for supporting a product they really like, because it is a way to express themselves, because they think their opinions are important for others.

..	Similarly they can be used in email or other types of communication to detect and exclude ‘flames’, i.e., overly heated or antagonistic language, and to enhance anti-spam systems. Also, online systems that display advertisements as sidebars can use opinion mining techniques to detect web pages that contain sensitive content inappropriate for ads placement [144]. Business intelligence is also one of the main factors behind corporate interest in the field of sentiment analysis [219]. Nowadays, companies invest more and more money in marketing strategies and they are constantly interested in both collecting and predicting the opinions and the attitudes of the general public towards their products and brands. The design of automatic tools capable to crawl reviews and opinions over the Web in real-time and to create condensed versions of them represents one of the most active research and development area. Several companies, in fact, already provide tools to track public viewpoints on a large scale by offering graphical summarisations of trends and opinions in the blogosphere (Table 1.1). The development of such systems, moreover, is not only important for commercial purposes, but also for government intelligence applications able to monitor increases in hostile or negative communications [1]. All of these tools, however, are still mainly keyword based and, hence, often fail to meet the gold standards of human annotators. The fundamental aim of this research work is to go beyond such approaches by developing common-sense knowledge bases to bridge the cognitive and affective gap between word-level natural language data and the concept-level opinions conveyed by these. Unlike keyword-based methods, sentic computing uses affective ontologies and common-sense reasoning tools for a concept-level analysis of natural language text.


Historia da analise de sentimentos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Durante grande parte do século passado, pesquisas em emoções foram conduzidas por filosofos e psicologos, que trabalhavam com um pequeno número de teorias sobre emoções e continuam em processo atualmente.

Os primeiros pesquisadores que tentaram conectar textos a emoções eram na verdade psicologos socias e antropologistas que tentaram encontrar similariedas em como as pessoas de diversas culturas se comunicam. Estas pesquisas foram tambem motivadas pela insatisfação gerada pelo fato dos humanos serem o centro domintante da cognição e processamento de informações.

Depois, na década de 80, pesquisadores começaram a especular sobre como computadores podem ser usados para estudar emoções. Programas de pesquisas nesta area começára a emegir na década de 1990. Por exemplo, quando Scherer implementou um modelo computacional de emoções em um sistema. Alguns anos depois, Picard publicou um livro que se tornou referência na area, gerando uma onda de interesses entre Cientistas da computação e engenheiros que procuravam formas de melhorar interface humano-computador coordenadas a partir de emoções das tarefas em demanda. Picard descreveu que há 3 tipos de aplicações computacionais afetivas.

 	1. Sistemas que detectam as emoções dos usuários.
 	2. Sistemas que expressam qual emoção humana seria.
 	3. Sistemas que realmente "sentem"  emoção.

Apesar de entrar no campo de HCI, e modelação afetiva, computação sentimental foca primeiramente na detecção afetiva de um texto. A detecção afetiva é crítica porque uma interface sentiva-afetiva nunca podera responder aos seus usuários estados afetivos se não pode sentir tais estados. A detecção afetiva não precisa ser perfeita, mas precisa se aproximar de seu objetivo final. Detecção afetiva é, contudo, um grande desafio porque emoções são contruidas com bordas Fuzzy e substancialmente se diferem a partir de experiencias e expressões individuais. Para se contrapor a estes desafios, a computação sentimental é contruida a partir de inspirações biologicas e psicologicas para categorizar um modelo que pode potencialmente descrever uma completa gama de experiencias em termos emocionais.

Em computação sentimental, a analise de linguagem natural é baseada em ontologias afetivas e senso comum resultando em ferramquentas, que permitem a anlise texto não apenas, em nivel de documento, pagina ou paragrafo, mas tamem de sentença e clausula. Em particular, computacação sentimental envolve o usa de AI e técnicas de Web Semantica, para conhecimento da representaçao e inferênca, matematica, para se encarregar de tarefas como mineração de grafos e redução de multi-dimensionalidade; linguitica, para discorrer uma analise pragmatival psicologia, para cognição e modelos afetivos; sociologia, para o entendimento da dinamica de uma rede social e sua influencia e finalmene etíca, para entender os problemas relacionados a natureza da mente e criação de máquinas emocionais.

.. In sentic computing, whose term derives from the Latin sentire (root of words such as sentiment and sentience) and sensus (intended both as capability of feeling and as common-sense), the analysis of natural language is based on affective ontologies and common-sense reasoning tools, which enable the analysis of text not only at document, page, or paragraph level, but also at sentence and clause level. In particular, sentic computing involves the use of AI and Semantic Web techniques, for knowledge representation and inference; mathematics, for carrying out tasks such as graph mining and multi-dimensionality reduction; linguistics, for discourse analysis and pragmatics; psychology, for cognitive and affective modelling; sociology, for understanding social network dynamics and social influence; finally ethics, for understanding related issues about the nature of mind and the creation of emotional machines. 

.. During most of the last century, research on emotions was conducted by philosophers and psychologists, whose work was based on a small set of emotion theories that continue to underpin research in this area. The first researchers to try linking text to emotions were actually social psychologists and anthropologists who tried to find similarities on how people from different cultures communicate [213]. This research was also triggered by a dissatisfaction with the dominant cognitive view centred around humans as ‘information processors’ [183].

.. Later on, in the 1980s, researchers such as Turkle [285] began to speculate about how computers might be used to study emotions. Systematic research programs along this front began to emerge in the early 1990s. For example, Scherer [249] implemented a computational model of emotion as an expert system. A few years later, Picard’s landmark book affective computing [228] prompted a wave of interest among computer scientists and engineers looking for ways to improve human-computer interfaces by coordinating emotions and cognition with task constraints and demands. Picard described three types of affective computing applications:

..	1. Systems that detect the emotions of the user;
..	2. Systems that express what a human would perceive as an emotion;
..	3. Systems that actually ‘feel’ an emotion.
	   
.. Although touching upon HCI and affective modelling, sentic computing primarily focuses on affect detection from text. Affect detection is critical because an affect-sensitive interface can never respond to users’ affective states if it cannot sense their affective states. Affect detection need not be perfect, but must be approximately on target. Affect detection is, however, a very challenging problem because emotions are constructs (i.e., conceptual quantities that cannot be directly measured) with fuzzy boundaries and with substantial individual difference variations in expression and experience. To overcome such a hurdle, sentic computing builds upon a biologically-inspired and psychologically-motivated affective categorisation model [52] that can potentially describe the full range of emotional experiences in terms of four independent but concomitant dimensions, whose different levels of activation make up the total emotional state of the mind.

..In sentic computing, whose term derives from the Latin sentire (root of words such as sentiment and sentience) and sensus (intended both as capability of feeling and as common-sense), the analysis of natural language is based on affective ontologies and common-sense reasoning tools, which enable the analysis of text not only at document, page, or paragraph level, but also at sentence and clause level. In particular, sentic computing involves the use of AI and Semantic Web techniques, for knowledge representation and inference; mathematics, for carrying out tasks such as graph mining and multi-dimensionality reduction; linguistics, for discourse analysis and pragmatics; psychology, for cognitive and affective modelling; sociology, for understanding social network dynamics and social influence; finally ethics, for understanding related issues about the nature of mind and the creation of emotional machines.




Mineração de Opniões
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Mineração de Opniões (Opnion Mining - OM) é uma recente subdiciplina que esta entre Recuperação de Informações e Linguistica Computacional a qual se preoucupa não apenas qual assunto se discute em um documento, mas nas opniões que estes documentos expressam. OM é copreendida por um vasto grupo de aplicações, desde rastreamento de opniões de usuários sobre produtos, gerenciamento do relacionamento com consumidores, até identificar a repercursão de candidados políticos em forums na Internet. Com o objetivo de extrair opniões de um texto, pesquisas recentes tentaram determinar automaticamente a polaridade (Positiva/Negativa) dos respectivos termos, isto é, identificam quando um texto analisado possuem uma conotação positiva ou negativa. Pesquisas que determinam se um texto possui um conteudo subjetivo ou não (objetivo) também são realizadas, mas são mais escassas.


A Mineração de Opniões pode ser compreendida por 3 subtarefas:
	1. Determinar polaridade-SO (Subjetivo/Objetivo), o que compreende em determinar a real natureza do texto, se ele descreve uma situação ou evento, sem expressar emoções ou opniões ou se o texto expressa opniões de carater subjetivo.
	2. Determinar polaridade-PN, o que compreende em decidir se um texto subjetivo expressa de forma positiva ou negativa uma opnião.
	3. Determinar a força da polaridade-PN, desta forma decidir o quão positivo ou negativo uma opnião é, desta forma pode-se classificar e odernar textos do mais Negativo ao mais Positivo por exemplo.



.. Opinion mining (OM) is a recent subdiscipline at the crossroads of information retrieval and computational linguistics which is concerned not with the topic a document is about, but with the opinion it expresses. OM has a rich set of applications, ranging from tracking users’ opinions about products or about political candidates as expressed in online forums, to customer relationship management. In order to aid the extraction of opinions from text, recent research has tried to automatically determine the “PN-polarity” of subjective terms, i.e.
.. identify whether a term that is a marker of opinionated content has a positive or a negative connotation. Research on determining whether a term is indeed a marker of opinionated content (a subjective term) or not (an objective term) has been, instead, much more scarce.

.. Opinion mining (OM – also known as “sentiment classification”) is a recent subdiscipline at the crossroads of information retrieval and computational linguistics which is concerned not with the topic a text is about, but with the opinion it expresses. Opinion-driven content management has several important applications, such as determining critics’ opinions about a given product by classifying online product reviews, or tracking the shifting attitudes of the general public towards a political candidate by mining online forums or blogs. Within OM, several subtasks can be identified, all of them having to do with tagging a given text according to expressed opinion: 
.. 	1. Determining text SO-polarity, as in deciding whether a given text has a factual nature (i.e. describes a given situation or event, without expressing a positive or a negative opinion on it) or expresses an opinion on its subject matter. This amounts to performing binary text categorization under categories Subjective and Objective (Pang and Lee, 2004; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003);
.. 	2. Determining text PN-polarity, as in deciding if a given Subjective text expresses a Positive or a Negative
.. 	opinion on its subject matter (Pang and Lee, 2004;Turney, 2002);
.. 	3. Determining the strength of text PN-polarity, as in deciding e.g. whether the Positive opinion expressed by a text on its subject matter is Weakly Positive, Mildly Positive, or Strongly Positive (Pang and Lee, 2005; Wilson et al., 2004).

.. The task of determining whether a term is indeed a marker of opinionated content (i.e. is Subjective or Objective) has instead received much less attention (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Riloff et al., 2003; Vegnaduzzo, 2004). Note that in these works no distinction between different senses of a word is attempted, so that the term, and not its senses, are classified (although some such works (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Kamps et al., 2004) distinguish between different POSs of a word).


O contexto das Midias Sociais
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Em um mundo onde milhões de pessoas expressão suas opniões sobre produtos comerciais em blogs, forums, chats e redes sociais, o entendimento deste conhecimento apartir de informação não estruturada pode ser um fator-chave para o pessoas ligadas a marketing de seus produtos e marcas. A analise automatica destas opiniões no entanto envolve um conhecimento profundo da linguagem natural nos textos por máquinas, o que por enquanto está muito longe do ideal. Os algoritmos responsáveis pela recuperação da informação online são muito bons em recuperar textos, dividi-los me partes, checar orografia, contar palavras, mas quando o assunto é interpretar as sentenças e extrair informação util dos usuários, suas capacidades são bastante limitadas.

É inerente que a natureza do conteudo de microblogs, como observado no Twitter e no Facebook possui serios desafios para a prática de aplicações em analise de sentimentos. Alguns dos desafios se apoiam no grande volume de conteúdo gerados por seus usuários, combinados com escassez de contexto resultado de um texto pequeno e a tendencia de à abreviações de linguagem e outras convenções (por exmeplo emoticons) para expressar sentimentos.

Com o recisamento das Redes Sociais, existe milhões de pessoas fornecendo seu conhecimento, o que significa que a informação é guardada, buscada e facilmente compartilhada. Com o inicio desta tendência, é criado e gerenciado um ecossistema de participações, onde informação é agregada por varias contribuições de usuários individuais. Estas contribuições, no entendao, tem o proposito de serem consumidas por humans, e normalmente são dificilmente acesíveis e processadas por computadores devido a sua não estruturação. Dar sentido a este enorme volume de dados socias disponíveis na internet requer o uso de diversas abordagens no entendimento de Linguagem Natural com o objetivo de estruturar estes dados, de tal forma que eles sejam facilmente agregados e análisados. Neste contexto, a computação de sentimentos pode ser explorada a partir do trabalho de NLP, assim inferir a semantica e o contéudo afetivo da informação contida no texto.


.. With the rise of the Social Web, there are now millions of humans offering their knowledge online, which means that the information is stored, searchable, and easily shared. This trend has created and maintained an ecosystem of participation, where value is created by the aggregation of many individual user contributions. Such contributions, however, are meant for human consumption and, hence, hardly accessible and processable by computers. Making sense of the huge amount of so cial data available on the Web requires the adoption of novel approaches to natural language understanding that can give a structure to such data, in a way that they can be more easily aggregated and analysed. In this context, sentic computing can be exploited for NLP tasks requiring the
.. inference of semantic and/or affective information associated with text, from big social data analysis [57] to management of online community data and metadata [119] to analysis of social network interaction dynamics [68]. This section, in particular, shows how the engine can be exploited for the development of a troll filtering system (section 5.1.1), a social media marketing tool (section 5.1.2), and an online personal photo management system (section 5.1.3).

.. The ways people express their opinions and sentiments have radically changed in the past few years thanks to the advent of social networks, web communities, blogs, wikis, and other online collaborative media. The distillation of knowledge from this huge amount of unstructured information can be a key factor for marketers who want to create an image or identity in the minds of their customers for their product, brand, or organisation. These online social data, however, remain hardly accessible to computers, as they are specifically meant for human consumption. The automatic analysis of online opinions, in fact, involves a deep understanding of natural language text by machines, from which we are still very far.

.. The inherent nature of microblog content - such as those observed on Twitter and Facebook - poses serious challenges to practical applications of sentiment analysis. Some of these challenges stem from the sheer rate and volume of user generated social content, combined with the contextual sparseness resulting from shortness of the text and a tendency to use abbreviated language conventions to express sentiments.

Senso Comum por trás dos sentimentos humanos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

O conhecimento comum das pessoas, é apenas uma camada superficial da Comunicação Humana e sozinha não é suficiente para entender a Linguagem Natural. Com o proposito de se juntar em uma conversa e ativamente participar dela, nós precisamos ter informação suficiente sobre os conceitos envolvidos e o contexto desta conversa, e principalmente precisamos saber falar.
Estas relações semanticas são o que chamamos de conhecimento de senso comum e consiste em saber coisas como pessoas são mais jovens que seus pais, que pessoas não gostam de serem interrompidas, que se você segurar uma faca pela lâmida vai se cortar, se você deixar papel cair na agua vai molhar, que as pessoas pagam o taxi depois de usar o serviço. Computadores não sabem este tipo de coisa,  pois eles nunca tiveram a oportunidade de viver e saber como estes intrisicos das palavras, dos objetos e das ações se relacionam uns com os outros. Se nós queremos que as máquinas realmente entedam a linguagem natural, precisamos prover a elas o conhecimento necessario. COnstruindo uma base de conhecimento de senso comum, talbez não seja tão facil, pois este senso norlmalmente são omitidos das counicações sociais. Quando pessoas comunicam umas com as outras, elas tendem a não prover informações que sejam obivias. Isto é verdade seja para comunicação direta face a face ou por comunicação assincrona como postagens na web, o que torna entender este senso comum muito mais díficil.

.. A similar intuition had previously been presented in (Kim and Hovy, 2004), whereby a term could have both a Positive and a Negative PN-polarity, each to a certain degree. A similar point has also recently been made in (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006), in which terms that possess a given opinion-related property to a higher degree are claimed to be also the ones on which human annotators asked to assign this property agree more. Nonbinary scores are attached to opinion-related properties also in (Turney and Littman, 2003), but the interpretation here is related to the confidence in the correctness of the labelling, rather than in how strong the term is deemed to possess the property.

.. Common knowledge, however, is just a surface layer of human communication
.. and alone is not enough for understanding natural language. In order to join in a
.. conversation and actively participate in it, we need to have some information about
.. the concepts and the context this conversation is based on but, before that, we need
.. to be able to speak. Trying to understand natural language by simply relying on
.. common knowledge would be pretty much like trying to join a conversation about
.. food, as a one-year old child: we would almost perfectly know the debated topics,
.. 1
.. http://geonames.org
.. 6364
.. 4 Tools
.. but we would not really know how to relate these concepts to each other in order
.. to fully understand or form a sentence. These semantic relationships are what we
.. call common-sense knowledge and consist in knowing that people are younger than
.. their parents, that a butcher is unlikely to be a vegetarian, that people do not like
.. being repeatedly interrupted, that if you hold a knife by its blade then it may cut
.. you, that if you drop paper into a flame then it will burn, that people pay taxi drivers
.. to drive them to places, that people generally sleep at night, and so forth.
.. Computers do not know such things, as they never had the opportunity to live
.. a life and to experience or be taught the meaning of words, objects, and actions,
.. and how these relate to each other. If we want machines to really understand nat-
.. ural language, hence, we need to provide them with such knowledge. Building a
.. common-sense knowledge base, however, is not easy as common-sense is typically
.. omitted from social communications. For Grice’s theory of pragmatics [120], in
.. fact, when people communicate with each other, they tend not to provide informa-
.. tion that is obvious or extraneous. This is true both for face-to-face communication
.. and for asynchronous communication (e.g., on the Web), which makes the collection
.. of common-sense an extremely difficult task.

Abordagem Principal: Criando, Tratando, Diversificando um Léxicos de Setimentos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

O conceito de sentimento léxico
*******************************

Léxico significa dicionário, é o conjunto de palavras de uma língua, com as respectivas significações. Neste caso, Léxico de sentimentos se refere a um dicionário de palavras que ao invés de possuir como contéudo o significado de cada palavra, possui em seu lugar um conteudo quantitativo (i.e. variação de -1 a 1, onde -1 é o mais negativo valor sentimental e 1 o valor mais positivo sentimental ) ou qualitativo (i. e. positivo/negativo, feliz/triste) uma referência sentimental.

Introduction:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Um núemro substancial de técnicas para análise de sentimentos se baseiam sobre tudo em Léxicos de Sentimentos. Um Léxico de sentimentos é uma lista de caracteristicas léxicas (palavras que são geralmente rotuladas de acordo com sua orientação sêmantica (normalmente positivo ou negativo).

Criar e validar manualmente estes dicionários de sentimentos, enquanto é um dos métodos mais robostusos e confiável é talmente o que mais consome tempo. Por esta razão, muitos métodos desenvolvem pesquisa se baseiam fortemente em léxicos preexistentes que foram manualmente construitos.

.. A substantial number of sentiment analysis approaches rely greatly on an underlying sentiment (or opinion) lexicon. A sentiment lexicon is a list of lexical features (e.g., words) which are generally labeled according to their semantic orientation as either positive or negative (Liu, 2010). 

.. Manually creating and validating such lists of opinion-bearing features, while being among the most robust methods for generating reliable sentiment lexicons, is also one of the most time-consuming.  For this reason, much of the applied research leveraging sentiment analysis relies heavily on preexisting manually constructed lexicons.

Trabalhos anteriores procuraram classificar documentos inteiros tratando uma polaridade positiva ou negativa geral, ou atráves de pontos de Reviews. Estes sistemas eram principa;,emte baseados em abordagens supervisionadas sobre amostras manualmente rotuladas, como comentários sobre de produtos e filmes onde as opniões positivas ou negativas eram explicitamente indicadas pelo usuário. No entanto, opniões e sentimentos não ocorrem somente no nível do documento, nem são limitadas a apenas uma única valência ou alvo. Atitudes contrárias ou complementares em cima de um mesmo ou multiplos tópicos podem se apresentar ao longo de um documento. Em trabalhos mais recentes, textos são gradualmente analisados no nível segmentos ou sentenças, utilizando a presençá de items léxicos que apontam para determinada opnião (palavra única ou n-grama) para detecter subjetividade nas sentençás, ou atráves da associal de regras que mineram caracteristicas de um Review de um produto.

.. Early works aimed to classify entire documents as containing overall positive or negative polarity, or rating scores of reviews. Such systems were mainly based on supervised approaches relying on manually labelled samples, such as movie or product reviews where the opinionist’s overall positive or negative attitude was explicitly indicated. However, opinions and sentiments do not occur only at document level, nor they are limited to a single valence or target. Contrary or complementary attitudes toward the same topic or multiple topics can be present across the span of a document. In more recent works, text analysis granularity has been taken down to segment and sentence level, e.g., by using presence of opinion-bearing lexical items (single words or n-grams) to detect subjective sentences, or by exploiting association rule mining for a feature-based analysis of product reviews.

Tentativa para se criar um Léxico de Sentimentos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A fim de avaliar diferenças por trás de diferentes perspectivas, três diferentes recursos, chamados Twitter 4 HashTag Repository, o banco de dados do LiveJournal 4 e um dataset PatientOpnion. Os resultados obtidos pelo Princeton's WordNet, MIT's ConceptNet e Microsoft's Probase foram comparados. 

O primeiro recurso é uma coleção de 3 mil tweets recuperados pelo Bing Web Repository explorando as Hashtags do Twitter como categorias de rotulação. Em particular, hashtags sobre eletronicos (iPhone, xBox, Android e Wii), companhias (Apple, Microsoft, Google), paises, cidades, sistemas operacionais e carros foram selecionas. Com o objetivo de testar a consistencia e a confiança, uma avaliação manual de 100 tweets foi realizada o que mostrou que as hashtagas tinham uma acuracia de 89%.

O segundo recurso é um banco de dados de 5 mil blogposts extraido do LiveJournal, uma comunidade virutal com mais de 23 milhões de usuários que mantém um blog, journal ou diario. Uma interessante caracteristica deste website é que bloggers são permitidos classíficar seus posts em categorias e emoção, escolhendo categorias e emoções predefinidas. Dados que a indicação da emoção é opcional, posts que possuem essa classificação tendem a refletir o real sentimento do autor. Depois de uma avaliação manual de 200 posts, de fato, a classificação de categorias apresenta bastante ruido (53% de acurácia). Os rótulos das emoções, no entando, mostraram bastante confiança (89% de acurácia) , então eles foram usados para analisar a performace da máquina de reconhecimento afetivo. 

O terceiro recurso, o dataset obtido do PatientOpnion, uma empresa social pioneira em realizar serviço de feedback online para usuários do serviço nacional de saúde do Reino Unido, com o o foco em permitir que as pessoas compartilhem online suas experiencias locais do serviço de saúde. Este dataset é rotulado manualmente a partir de 2 mil opniões de pacientes que associavam além de categorias pre-estabelecidas a polaridade de suas opnioes.

.. In order to evaluate the different facets of the engine from different perspectives, three different resources, namely a Twitter 4 hashtag repository, a LiveJournal 5 database and a PatientOpinion 6 dataset, were used and results obtained using Princeton’s WordNet 7 , MIT’s ConceptNet 8 and Microsoft’s Probase 9 were compared. The first resource is a collection of 3,000 tweets crawled from Bing 10 web repository by exploiting Twitter hashtags as category labels, which is useful to test the engine’s target spotting performance. In particular, hashtags about electronics (e.g., IPhone, XBox, Android and Wii), companies (e.g., Apple, Microsoft and Google), countries, cities, operative systems and cars were selected. In order to test the resource’s consistency and reliability, a manual evaluation of 100 tweets was performed, which showed that hashtags are accurate to 89%.

.. The second resource is a 5,000 blogpost database extracted from LiveJournal, a virtual community of more than 23 millions users who keep a blog, journal or diary. An interesting feature of this website is that bloggers are allowed to label their posts with both a category and a mood tag, by choosing from predefined categories and mood themes. Since the indication of mood tags is optional, posts are likely to reflect the true mood of the authors, which is not always true for category tags. After a manual evaluation of 200 posts, in fact, the category tags turned out to be very noisy (53% accuracy). The mood tags, however, showed a good enough reliability (89% accuracy) so they were used to test the engine’s affect recognition performance.

..  The third resource, eventually, is a dataset obtained from PatientOpinion, a social enterprise pioneering an online feedback service for users of the UK national health service to enable people to share their recent experience of local health services online. It is a manually tagged dataset of 2,000 patient opinions that associates to each post a category (namely, clinical service, communication, food, parking, staff, and timeliness) and a positive or negative polarity. It was used to test the detection of opinion targets and the polarity associated with these. There are no ethical issues involved in the data used in the experimentation as tweets, blogposts, and patient opinions were all anonymised. In order to guarantee full anonymity, moreover, the text associated with tweets, blogposts, and patient opinions has never been wholly reported in the proposed tables and examples.


Mecanismo para construir e validar um Léxico de Sentimentos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A criação manual de um léxico de sentimentos confiável é um trabalho intensivo e algumas vezes passívo de erros, portanto não é novidade que muitos pesquisadores da Análise de Sentimentos se baseiam em léxicos ja existentes como ponto inicial de suas pesquisas. Desta forma há muita sobreposição nos vocabulários destas pesquisas, mas no entando há muitas particularidades de cada uma.

.. Manually creating (much less, validating) a comprehensive sentiment lexicon is a labor intensive and sometimes error prone process, so it is no wonder that many opinion mining researchers and practitioners rely so heavily on existing lexicons as primary resources. There is, of course, a great deal of overlap in the vocabulary covered by such lexicons; however, there are also numerous items unique to each.

Alvo em mídia Sociais
---------------------

Inspirado por já bem estabelecidos bancos de palavras (LIWC, ANEW e GI). Uma boa dica é incorporar diversas caracteristicas léxicas communs a análise de expressões em microblogs, incluindo uma lista completa de Emoticons (por exemplo, :-) que detona um rosto sorridente e geralmente indica sentimetos positivos), acronimos relacionados a sentimentos e inicialismo (LOL, WTF expressam certo sentimento) e gírias com valores sentimentais.

Os mecanismos de viralização dentro das redes sociais
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

O que principalmente faz das redes sociais uma forte mida de marketing é sua capacidade de viralização. A propagação das messagenns replicadas de pessoa para pessoa ao inves da compra de alguma propaganda ou promoção. A messagem não tem que necessariamente discutir um produto. Diversas campanhas virais, de fato, tem seu alcance graças a alguma messagem ocasional, com o logo da companhia acidentalmente incluida. No coração da viralização esta a tentantiva de entender o que é natural, ou espontâneo no universo das redes sociais é o meio mais efetivo para alcançar as pessoas. O poder do marketing reside portanto não em empurrar a informação para as massas, mas em efetivamente alcançar aqules individuos que exercem influencia sobre outros. O marketeiro de sucesso é aquele que usa seus consumidores e a cultura em sua vantagem, gerando mensagens com os os consumidores ao inves de jogar mensagens deles. Para confirmar o crescente interesse nes novo tipo de marketing, diversas ferramentas comerciais e academicas foram desenvolvidas para fornecer as companhias formas de analisar a blogoesfera em larga escla, a fim de extrair informação sobe tentencias de opnioes relativas a seus produtos. Não obstante a maioria das ferramentas existentes e os esforçoes de pesquisas são limitados a avaliação de polarariadade ou a classificação de emoções em um conjunto muito limitado. Além do mais, tais metodos reisidem principalmente em parte do texto em que o estado emocional é explicitado e portanto não são capazes de capturar a opniao e sentimentos que são expressos implicitamente.

.. What mainly makes social media marketing work is the buzz mechanism [248]. A buzz replicates a message through user-to-user contact, rather than purchasing some advertising or promoting a press release. The message does not have to necessarily deal with the product. Many successful viral campaigns, in fact, have spread thanks to a compelling message, with the company logo included incidentally. At the heart of buzz is an understanding that the natural, spontaneous networks that comprise the social universe are the most effective means of reaching people in a meaningful way. The power of marketing lies, therefore, not in pushing information to the masses, but in effectively tapping those individuals who wield influence over others. The marketers who are winning are the ones using consumers and culture to their advantage, crafting messages with consumers rather than throwing messages at them. In confirmation of the growing interest in this novel approach to marketing, several academic and commercial tools, e.g., OASYS 1 [66], ESSE [264], Luminoso 2 [269], Factiva 3 , NM Incite 4 , Attensity 5 , and Converseon 6 , have been developed to provide companies (and users) with a way to analyse the blogosphere on a large scale, in order to extract information about the trend of the opinions relative to their products. Nevertheless most of the existing tools and the research efforts are limited to a polarity evaluation or a mood classification according to a very limited set of emotions. In addition, such methods mainly rely on parts of text in which emotional states are explicitly expressed and, hence, are unable to capture opinions and sentiments that are expressed implicitly.


Subjetividade e Objetividade dentro da Análise de Sentimentos
-------------------------------------------------------------

Outra subtarefa comum da Mineração de Opnião e Análise de Sentimentos são a detecção de subjetividade e a identificação de opnião. A capacidade de distinguir se um texto, ou parte de um texto, são subjetivas ou objetibas pode ser particularmente benédico para uma classificação de sentimentos efetiva. Pesquisas mostram que a complexidade desta tarefa é superior que a subsenquente classificação da polaridade. Também foi mostrado como a classificação de um pedação de um texto como expressando opnião neutra não é igual a classificação de uma parte de um texto objetivo. Uma parte do texto pode também possuir uma polaridade sem que necessariamente contenha uma opnião, por exemplo um artigo de notícias pode ser classificado como uma boa ou uma má noticia sem ser subjetivo. A classificação de uma parte do texto como subjetiva ou objetica pode ser útil em diversas situações. Por exemplo, ser capaz de distinguir dentro de textos opniados quando um autor explicitamente expressa seu sentumento atráves de uma afimação (e. g. , "este laptop é ótimo") e quando ele fornece informação objetiva (e. g., "este laptop tem uma tela grande") é usado para facilitar a determinação do sentimento global. Pesquisas examinaram o efeito da orientação dos adjetivos e sua graduação em sentenças objetivas para detectar se a senteça é subhetiva enquanto outros projetos tentaram deterctar a subjetividade em um nivel inferior. Tipicamente, a análise de sentimentos é realizada atrásves de um tópico do documento. No entando, alguns estudos sugerem que gerenciar a tarefa de análise de sentimentos junto com a identificação de um tópico pode ser benefico para uma performace global. De acordo com outras pesquisas, a filtragem de tópicos em texto e a filtragem de subjetividade são complementares, no contexto de experiencia em extração da informação. Por exemplo, passagens do texto fora de um tópico pode conter informação inrelevante no ponto de vista sentimental e assim o resultado da polaridade pode ficar distorcida do sentimento global do tópico analisado. Além do mais, exitem documentos que contém material sobre multiplo tópicos que pode ser interessante ao usuario. Neste caso, é necessario a identificação de topicos e um avaliação individual das opniões associadas a eles. Diversas outras pesquisas em análise de sentimentos foca numa abordagem não sobre tópicos mas sim baseada na classificação dos documentos de acordo com seu genero, seu estilo e autoria. Outro problema a se considerar de forma inteligente e segura é a detecção de um linguagem enganosa. Detectar emoções, eventualmente, é uma tarefa que esta ganhando atençao de diferentes perspectivas e aplicações.

.. Other common sub-tasks of opinion mining and sentiment analysis are subjectivity detection and opinion identification. The capability of distinguishing if a text, or parts of it, are subjective or objective can be particularly beneficial for a more effective sentiment classification. Mihalcea et al. showed evidence that the complexity of this task is superior than subsequent polarity classification [195]. Wilson et al. remarked how classifying a piece of text as expressing a neutral opinion for rating inference does not equal classifying that piece of text as objective [305].2.1 Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis 15 A piece of text can also have a polarity without necessarily containing an opinion, for example a news article can be classified into good or bad news without being subjective. The classification of a piece of text as subjective or objective can be useful in several situations. For example, being able to distinguish in opinionated texts where the authors do explicitly express their sentiment through statements (e.g., “this laptop is great”) and where they provide objective information (e.g., “the laptop has long battery life”) is used to help determine the overall sentiment. Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe examined the effects of adjective orientation and gradability on sentence subjectivity to detect if a sentence is subjective [130] while other projects address subjectivity detection at sub-sentence level. Wiebe et al. presented a comprehensive survey of subjectivity recognition using different clues and features [301]. Typically, sentiment analysis is performed over an on-topic document, e.g., on the result of a topic-based search engine. However, several studies suggested that managing these two task jointly can be beneficial for the overall performance. According to Riloff et al., topic-based text filtering and subjectivity filtering are complementary, in the context of experiments in information extraction [243]. For example, off-topic passages of a document could contain irrelevant affective information and result misleading for the global sentiment polarity about the main topic. Also, a document can contain material on multiple topics that may be of interest to the user. In this case, it is therefore necessary to identify the topics and separate the opinions associated with each of them. Several other researches in sentiment analysis focus on non-topic based categorisation, for example to classify documents according to their genre [109] and their style [24]. Also authorship and publisher identification are other relevant examples [202, 13]. Another problem that has been considered in intelligence and security settings is the detection of deceptive language. Affect detection, eventually, is also a task that is gaining a growing attention from different perspectives and for different applications.


Atribuir graus de polaridade a termos
-------------------------------------

Uma das tarefas mais comuns na mineração de opniões é a classificação da polaridade e a associação de graus de polaridade, que, dado um texto opninado em que se assume que a opnião globbal é sobre um determinado item, classificar esta opnião entre duas diferentes polaridades de sentimentos, ou localizar um espaço continuo entre estas polaridades. Muito trabalho na classificação da polarididade de sentimentos foi conduzido no contexto da analise de opniões em reviews (e, g, "Curtir", "Não Curtiu"). Somando a isso, classificação de polaridade pode também ser aplicada para identificar como os prós e contras de uma determinada opnião influenciaram o julgamento de um produto e assim esclaresser como esse julgamento é confiavel. Outra instancia da identificação de sentimentos binaria é a detecão de concordância, que é, dado uma parte de um texto, decidir quando devese receber o mesmo ou uma rotulação de sentimento diferente. O problema geral está na inferencia de avaliação, quando alguem deve determinar avaliação de um autor com respeito a uma escala de multiplos pontons (e. g. cinco estrelas em um Review) oide ser visto como um problema de categorização multi-classe.

.. One of the most common sub-tasks of opinion mining is polarity classification and the assignment of degrees of positivity, that is, given an opinionated piece of text wherein it is assumed that the overall opinion is about one single issue or item, classify the opinion as falling under one of two opposing sentiment polarities, or locate its position on the continuum between these two polarities. Much work on sentiment polarity classification has been conducted in the context of reviews of evaluative opinions (e.g., ‘thumbs up’ versus ‘thumbs down’, or ‘like’ versus ‘dislike’). In addition, polarity classification can be also applied to identifying ‘pro and con’ expressions that can be used in individual reviews to evaluate the pros and cons that have influenced the judgements of a product and that make such judgements more trustworthy. Another instance of binary sentiment classification is agreement detection, that is, given a pair of text documents, deciding whether they should receive the same or differing sentiment related labels. The more general problem of rating inference, where one must determine the author’s evaluation with respect to a multipoint scale (e.g., one to five stars for a review) can be viewed as a multi-class text categorisation problem. Other common sub-tasks of opinion mining and sentiment analysis are subjectivity detection and opinion identification. The capability of distinguishing if a text, or parts of it, are subjective or objective can be particularly beneficial for a more effective sentiment classification. Mihalcea et al. showed evidence that the complexity of this task is superior than subsequent polarity classification [195]. Wilson et al. remarked how classifying a piece of text as expressing a neutral opinion for rating inference does not equal classifying that piece of text as objective [305].

Análise de Sentimentos: Complexidade e Evolução
-----------------------------------------------

A evolução dos trabalhos de pesquisa no campo de mineração de opnião e análise de sentimentos podem ser vistos não somente como o uso de téquinas cada vez mais sofisticadas, mas também em profundidades de análise adotadas diferentes. As primeiras pesquisas, de fato, procuraram classificar documentos inteiros com uma determinada polaridade positiva ou negativa. Estas técnicas eram baseadas em abordagens supervisionadas a partir de amostras rotuladas manualmente. No entando, opinioes e sentimentos não ocorrem somente em nível de documento, e nem mesmo são limitados por uma única valencia ou alvo. Atitudes contrarias ou complementares em cima de um único tópico ou multiplo tópicos podem estar presentes ao longo de um documento. Trabalhos posteriores adotaram análise sobre segmentos  do texto com objetivo de distinguir seções sentimentais ou não sentimentais, utilizando técnicas baseadas em técnicas de grafos por seções de segmentos de um documento baseado em sua subjetividade, ou pela classificação baseada em uma sintaxe fixa de frases que tendem a expressar opniões, ou a geração de um pequeno conjunto de palavras que opnião em uma base dados como o WordNet. 

.. The evolution of research works in the field of opinion mining and sentiment analysis can be seen not only in the use of more and more sophisticated techniques, but also in the different depths of analysis adopted. Early works, in fact, aimed to classify entire documents as containing overall positive or negative polarity [220] or rating scores (e.g., 1-5 stars) of reviews [218]. These were mainly supervised approaches relying on manually labelled samples, such as movie or product reviews where the opinionist’s overall positive or negative attitude was explicitly indicated. However, opinions and sentiments do not occur only at document level, nor are they limited to a single valence or target. Contrary or complementary attitudes toward the same topic or multiple topics can be present across the span of a document. Later works adopted a segment level opinion analysis aiming to distinguish sentimental from non-sentimental sections, e.g., by using graph-based techniques for segmenting sections of a document on the basis of their subjectivity [217], or by performing a classification based on some fixed syntactic phrases that are likely to be used to express opinions [286], or by bootstrapping using a small set of seed opinion words and a knowledge base such as WordNet [148].

Todas as abordagens, no entando, estão distantes de poderem conseguir inferir a cognição e a emoção da informação associada com a linguagem natural já que este tipo de análise se baseia no conhecimento da semântica da base de conhecimentos o que está ainda muito limitado para processar uma sentença de forma eficiente. Além do mais, este tipo de análise granular provavelmente não é suficiente para identificar em uma determinada sentença alguma coisa além de apenas uma única opnião.

.. All such approaches, however, are still far from being able to infer the cognitive and affective information associated with natural language as they mainly rely on semantic knowledge bases which are still too limited to efficiently process text at sentence level. Moreover, such a text analysis granularity might still not be enough as a single sentence may express more than one opinion [305].

Em trabalhos mais recentes, textos são gradualmente analisados no nível segmentos ou sentenças, utilizando a presençá de items léxicos que apontam para determinada opnião (palavra única ou n-grama) para detecter subjetividade nas sentençás, ou atráves da associal de regras que mineram caracteristicas de um Review de um produto. Normarmalmente em certo nivel de subjetividade que existe em sentenças adjacentes, como autor normalmente não troca muito frequentemente entre subjetividade e objetividade. Desta forma, alguns trabalhos tábem prooem uma classificação coletiva do documento baseada em preferencias atribuidas por pares de sentenças proximas

.. In recent works, text analysis granularity has been taken down to sentence level, e.g., by using presence of opinion-bearing lexical items (single words or n-grams) to detect subjective sentences [154, 242], or by using semantic frames defined in FrameNet [16] for identifying the topics (or targets) of sentiment [155], or by exploiting association rule mining [4] for a feature-based analysis of product reviews [141].
.. Commonly, a certain degree of continuity exists in subjectivity labels of adjacent sentences, as an author usually does not switch too frequently between being subjective and being objective. Hence, some works also propose a collective classification of the document based on assigning preferences for pairs of nearby sentences [218, 314].

**De palavras-chave a conceitos**

Existem abordagens que podem ser agrupadas em três principais categorias, com algumas exeções:
	1. Palavras-chaves correspondentes:
	Provavelmente esta é a técnica mais popular pela sua economia e acessibilidade. O texto é classificado em catégorias agetivas baseada na presenca de palavras emotivas como, "alegre", "triste", "medo". Por exemplo o Elliott's Addective Reasoner, que observou 198 palavras-chaves afetivas mais modificadores de intesidade (muito, extremamente, mais ou menos) e mais algumas frases-chaves (fez isso, queria aquilo). Outra popular fonte de palavras afetivas é o Ortony's Affective Lexicon, que agroupa termos em categotias afetivas. O ponto fraco desta abordagem cai sobre duas areas:
	
		* Um pobre reconhecimento quando palavras negativas são utilizadas como (não quero isso, não gosto). Desta forma enquanto a abordagem conesegue corretamente classificar sentencas como "hoje é um dia feliz" como positivo, provalvelmente vai falhar em sentenças como "o dia não esta feliz".
		* A segunda fraqueza, é que a técnica se baseia na presençA obvia de palavras que expressam sentimento, o que é apenas uma analise superficial do texto. Por exemplo, no texto "Meu marido acabou de pedir divorcio e quer a guarda dos filhos"  certamente envolve emoções fortes e negativas, mas não possui palavras-chaves e portando não pode ser classificado.

	2. Afinidade Lexica: 
	A afinidade léxica é uma técnica um pouco mais sofisticada do que a correspondecia de palavras chaves, pois enquando não espera detectar palavras obvias que expressam opnião, ela atribui às palavras uma probabilidade de afinidade com uma emoção em particular. Por exemplo, "acidente" tende a ser classificada com 75% de probabilidade de indicar uma emoção negativa, como em "acidente de carro" ou "corte por acidente". Estas probabilidades são normalmente treinadas apartir de um corpo linguistico. A pesar da afinidade léxica ter uma performace melhor do que puramente a correspodencia de palavras-chaves, existem dois problemas básicos nesta abordagem.
		
		* Primeiro, afinidade léxica, operando somente no nível de palavras, pode ser facilmente enganada com por exemplo "Eu evitei o acidente" (negação) e "Eu conheci minha namorada por acidente" (Outro sentido para a palavra).
		* Segundo, a probabilidade da afinidade léxica possui um viés em direção a textos de genero em particular, ditado pela fonte do corpo linguistico utilizado para treinamento. Isto torna um pouco dificil gerar um modelo indepedente, dinâmico e reusável. 

	3. Métodos estatisticos:
	Métodos estatisticos, como a análise semântica latente (LSA) e máquina de vetores de suporte (SVM), vêm sendo populares para a classificação de textos  e vem sendo utlizado por diversas pesquisas. Alimentar uma máquina de apredizagem para treinamento com um grande conjunto de dados com emoções anotadas ao textos, é uma técnica capaz de permitir que sistemas não apenas aprendam a probabilidade afetiva das palavras-chaves, mas explora tambem palavras abirtrarias, pontuação, frequencia de co-ocorrencia de palavras em um modelo estatistico que possui pouco valor individual. Como resultado, classificadores de textis estatisticos somente funcionam com uma acurácia aceitável se for treinado por um texto suficientemente grande. Então, enquanto este método é capaz de classificar sentimentalmente texto de usuárias em nível de paragrafo ou página, esta técnica não funciona muito bem com pequenas unidades de texto como frases.



.. Existing approaches can be grouped into three main categories, with few exceptions: keyword spotting, lexical affinity, and statistical methods. Keyword spotting is the most na ̈ıve approach and probably also the most popular because of its accessibility and economy. Text is classified into affect categories based on the presence of fairly unambiguous affect words like ‘happy’, ‘sad’, ‘afraid’, and ‘bored’. Elliott’s Affective Reasoner [100], for example, watches for 198 affect keywords, e.g., ‘distressed’ and ‘enraged’, plus affect intensity modifiers, e.g., ‘extremely’, ‘somewhat’, and ‘mildly’, plus a handful of cue phrases, e.g., ‘did that’ and ‘wanted to’. Other popular sources of affect words are Ortony’s Affective Lexicon [212], which groups terms into affective categories, and Wiebe’s linguistic annotation scheme [302]. The weaknesses of this approach lie in two areas: poor recognition of affect when negation is involved and reliance on surface features. About its first weakness, while the approach can correctly classify the sentence “today was a happy day” as being happy, it is likely to fail on a sentence like “today wasn’t a happy day at all”. About its second weakness, the approach relies on the presence of obvious affect words which are only surface features of the prose. In practice, a lot of sentences convey affect through underlying meaning rather than affect adjectives. For example, the text “My husband just filed for divorce and he wants to take custody of my children away from me” certainly evokes strong emotions, but uses no affect keywords, and therefore, cannot be classified using a keyword spotting approach. Lexical affinity is slightly more sophisticated than keyword spotting as, rather than simply detecting obvious affect words; it assigns
.. arbitrary words a probabilistic ‘affinity’ for a particular emotion. For example, ‘accident’ might be assigned a 75% probability of being indicating a negative affect, as in ‘car accident’ or ‘hurt by accident’. These probabilities are usually trained from
.. linguistic corpora [304, 272, 262, 237].

.. Though often outperforming pure keyword spotting, there are two main problems with the approach. First, lexical affinity, operating solely on the word-level, can easily be tricked by sentences like “I avoided an accident” (negation) and “I met my girlfriend by accident” (other word senses). Second, lexical affinity probabilities are often biased toward text of a particular genre, dictated by the source of the linguistic corpora. This makes it difficult to develop a reusable, domain-independent model. Statistical methods, such as latent semantic analysis (LSA) and support vector machine (SVM), have been popular for affect classification of texts and have been used by researchers on projects such as Goertzel’s Webmind [117], Pang’s movie review  classifier [220], and many others [218, 141, 287, 2, 291, 209, 92].

.. By feeding a machine learning algorithm a large training corpus of affectively annotated texts, it is possible for the systems to not only learn the affective valence of affect keywords as in the keyword spotting approach, but such a system can also take into account the valence of other arbitrary keywords (like lexical affinity), punctuation, and word co-occurrence frequencies. However, statistical methods are generally semantically weak, meaning that, with the exception of obvious affect keywords, other lexical or co-occurrence elements in a statistical model have little predictive value individually. As a result, statistical text classifiers only work with acceptable accuracy when given a sufficiently large text input. So, while these methods may be able to affectively classify user’s text on the page or paragraph level, they do not work well on smaller text units such as sentences.

Avaliação (Vader?)
------------------

A fim de um mecanismo realizar a mineração de opnião em tempo real, um vetor de sentimentos associados a cada AffectNet conceito pode ser calculado a priori e salvo em um banco de dados SQL. Em tempo de execução, o vetor de sentimentos relativos a cada conceito compondo o SBoC pode ser recuperado des banco de dados e agragado a computação da informação afetiva global asociada ao SBoC especifico. Isto permite que o processo de extração de sentimentos seja mais rápido do que aplicando o AffectiveSpace diretamente no processo. Similarmente, associaão espectral pode ser computada a prior no IsaCore e a classificação semantica de cada conceito (que é a rotulação de diferentes topicos e as confidencia associadas) podem ser guardadas em um banco de dados SQL.

.. In order for the engine to perform fast real-time opinion mining, the sentic vector associated with each AffectNet concept can be calculated a priori and saved in an SQL database. At run-time, then, the sentic vectors relative to each of the concepts composing the SBoC can be retrieved from such a database and aggregated to compute the overall affective information associated with the specific SBoC. This allows the sentics extraction process to be faster than directly applying the AffectiveSpace process. Similarly, spectral association can be computed a priori on IsaCore and the semantic classification of each concept (that is, a set of different topic labels and the confidence associated with these) can be stored in an SQL database.

Estes então são processados concorrentemente pelos modulos do IsaCore e pelo AffectiveSpace, dos quais possuem uma saída cognitiva e afetiva da informação associada a cada SBoC, ambos de forma discreta, com um ou mais rotulos, e de forma dimensional, com o valor de polaridade 2 [-1,1]. O mecanismo desenvolvido supera os principais problemas encontradas pelo estado-da-arte (técnicas baseadas em palavras-chaves). Graçás  a exploração de bases com conhecimento de senso comum que permite uma analise a nível de conceito do texto, de fato, o mecanismo de mineração de opnião é capaz de inferir mais efetivamente a informação de cognição e a afeição associada a linguagem natural. A validade desta técnica proposta, depende altamente de dois fatores principais:
	* A riquesa de conhecimento das bases.
	* Acuracia do parser de sentimentos.

Se um conceito é encontrado sem correspondência da base em um texto opniado, o mecanismo não será capaz de inferir a semantica e os sentimentos associados a tal conceito, portanto, não devera ser corretamente realizado a análise de sentimentos feral no texto de entrada. Pela mesma razão, a acuracia do mecanismo tambem depende na precisão da detecção de conceitos pelo parser de sentimentos. O parser de sentimentos pode reconhecer conceitos complexos, por exemplo, o conceito "comporar um presente de natal", é uma sentença rica em informações, por exmeplo , eu comprei um tando de presentes de natal legais". No entando, o parser não seria capaz de extrair conceitos em sentençás como, eu comprei um tanto de sinos legais para minha mae. Dado que a versão atual do parser é vaseada em n-gramas, de fato, não é capaz de distinguir que um sino é tambem um presente neste caso, desta forma, não e capaz de detectar o conceito "Comprar presente de natal". Ainda mais, dados que o conceito "comprar um sino natalino" não esta no AffectNet, o mecanismo não sera capaz de inferir a semantica e o sentido associado a este conceito,  mesmo que a base de conhecimento do senso comum de afeições contenha a informação sobre isto. Neste caso,  contudo, o parser de sentimento seria capaz de extrair conceitos como "comprar", "natal", "sino" e assim realizar um bom adivinho sobre a semantica e o sentido dos textos assiciados na entrada. Em média de fato, SBoCs praticamente consiste em conceitos de palavras únicas ou bigramas, de forma que a validade da abordagem proposta depende da riquesa do AffectNet e do IsaCore. Para este fim, a avaliação do processo realizada em um nivel basico de conhecimento. Uma avaliaão corroborativa deste mecanismo de mineração de opnião, de fato, não foi possível porque datasets disponiveis capazes de testar no campo de analise de sentimentos são ainda muito poucos e não existe benchmarks reconhecidos universalmente que servem como vase para comprar diferentes tecnicas ou diferentes configurações de um mesmo método.


.. These are then concurrently processed by the IsaCore and the AffectiveSpace modules, which output the cognitive and affective information associated with each SBoC, both in a discrete way, with one or more labels, and in a dimensional way, with a polarity value 2 [-1,+1] (Table 4.4). The developed engine overcomes the main problems faced by state-of-the art keyword-based approaches. Thanks to the exploitation of common-sense knowledge bases that allow a concept-level analysis of text, in fact, the opinion mining engine is able to more effectively infer the cognitive and affective information associated with natural language. The validity of the proposed approach, hence, highly depends on two main factors: the richness of the knowledge bases and the accuracy of the sentic parser.

.. If a concept for which there is no match in the knowledge bases is encountered in the opinionated text, the engine will not be able to infer the semantics and sentics associated with such concept and, hence, it might not be able to correctly perform the overall feature-based sentiment analysis of the input text. For the same reason, the accuracy of the engine process also depends on the concept detection precision of the sentic parser. As shown in the previous section, the sentic parser can recognise complex concepts, e.g., the concept ‘buy christmas present’, in information-rich sentences, e.g.,“I bought a lot of very nice Christmas presents”. However, the parser would not be able to extract the same concept from a sentence like “I bought some nice Christmas bells for my mom”. Since the current version of the parser is based on n-grams, in fact, it is not able to guess that a bell, in this case, is a Christmas present and, hence, does not detect the concept ‘buy christmas present’. Since, moreover, the concept ‘buy christmas bell’ is not contained in AffectNet, the engine will not be able to infer the semantics and sentics associated with that concept, despite the affective common-sense knowledge base actually contains information about it. In this case, however, the sentic parser would be able to extract concepts such as ‘buy’, ‘christmas’, and ‘bell’ and, hence, make a good-enough guess about the semantics and sentics associated to the input text. On average, in fact, SBoCs mostly consist of single-word or two-word concepts, hence, the validity of the proposed approach mainly depends on the richness of AffectNet and IsaCore. To this end, the evaluation process was performed at knowledge base level. An extensive corroborative evaluation of the opinion mining engine, in fact, was not possible because currently available test datasets in the field of sentiment analysis are still very few and there are no universally recognised benchmarks that can serve as a basis for comparing different techniques or different configurations of the same method.

Uma avaliação comparativa de mecanismo com técnicas estado-da-arte, ainda mais, não é praticavel pelas abordagens baseadas em palavras-chaves, ao invés de conceitos, e tem como alvo um nível de documento ou paragravo ao invés de sentenças ou clausulas, na análise de sentimentos. Assim, a fim de avaliar diferentes facetas dos mecanismos de mineração de opnião a partir de diversas pespectivas, tres diferentes recursos foram usados,.


A fim de avaliar diferenças por trás de diferentes perspectivas, três diferentes recursos, chamados Twitter 4 HashTag Repository, o banco de dados do LiveJournal 4 e um dataset PatientOpnion. Os resultados obtidos pelo Princeton's WordNet, MIT's ConceptNet e Microsoft's Probase foram comparados. 

O primeiro recurso é uma coleção de 3 mil tweets recuperados pelo Bing Web Repository explorando as Hashtags do Twitter como categorias de rotulação. Em particular, hashtags sobre eletronicos (iPhone, xBox, Android e Wii), companhias (Apple, Microsoft, Google), paises, cidades, sistemas operacionais e carros foram selecionas. Com o objetivo de testar a consistencia e a confiança, uma avaliação manual de 100 tweets foi realizada o que mostrou que as hashtagas tinham uma acuracia de 89%.

O segundo recurso é um banco de dados de 5 mil blogposts extraido do LiveJournal, uma comunidade virutal com mais de 23 milhões de usuários que mantém um blog, journal ou diario. Uma interessante caracteristica deste website é que bloggers são permitidos classíficar seus posts em categorias e emoção, escolhendo categorias e emoções predefinidas. Dados que a indicação da emoção é opcional, posts que possuem essa classificação tendem a refletir o real sentimento do autor. Depois de uma avaliação manual de 200 posts, de fato, a classificação de categorias apresenta bastante ruido (53% de acurácia). Os rótulos das emoções, no entando, mostraram bastante confiança (89% de acurácia) , então eles foram usados para analisar a performace da máquina de reconhecimento afetivo. 

O terceiro recurso, o dataset obtido do PatientOpnion, uma empresa social pioneira em realizar serviço de feedback online para usuários do serviço nacional de saúde do Reino Unido, com o o foco em permitir que as pessoas compartilhem online suas experiencias locais do serviço de saúde. Este dataset é rotulado manualmente a partir de 2 mil opniões de pacientes que associavam além de categorias pre-estabelecidas a polaridade de suas opnioes.

.. A comparative evaluation of the engine with state-of-the-art techniques, more over, was not feasible as most of current approaches are keyword-based, rather than concept-based, and aim for a document- or paragraph-level, rather than sentence- or clause-level, sentiment analysis. Hence, in order to evaluate the different facets of the opinion mining engine from various perspectives, three different resources were used, namely a Twitter hashtag repository, a LiveJournal database, and a Patient-
.. Opinion dataset, and results were compared with those obtained by using WordNet, ConceptNet, and Probase, in place of the two developed knowledge bases. Each of the evaluation resources has been selected to test a specific capability of the engine, according to the different properties of each test dataset. Specifically, the Twitter hashtag repository has been chosen for testing the precision of the engine in inferring semantics, the LiveJournal database has been selected to assess the engine’s
.. accuracy in extracting sentics, while the PatientOpinion dataset has been used for evaluating the inference of both semantics and sentics concurrently. The Twitter hashtag repository, in particular, is a subset of the dataset used in Song et al. [263] for short text conceptualisation and consists of 3,000 tweets crawled from Bing web repository by exploiting Twitter hashtags as category labels. Such hashtags pertain to electronics (e.g., IPhone, XBox, Android, and Wii), companies (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, and Google), countries, cities, operative systems, and cars. In order to test the resource’s consistency and reliability, a manual evalua tion of 100 tweets was performed, which showed that hashtags are accurate to 91%.

.. The LiveJournal database, in turn, is a variation of the dataset used by Strapparava and Mihalcea [274] for emotion annotation and consists in a collection of 5,000 blogpost database extracted from LiveJournal, a virtual community of more than 23 millions users who keep a blog, journal, or diary. An interesting feature of this website is that bloggers are allowed to label their posts with both a category and a mood tag, by choosing from predefined categories and mood themes or by creating new ones. Since the indication of mood tags is optional, posts are likely to reflect the true mood of the authors, which is not always true for category tags.

.. After a manual evaluation of 200 posts, in fact, the category tags turned out to be very noisy (53% accuracy). The mood tags, however, showed a good enough reliability (89% accuracy) so they were used to test the engine’s affect recognition performance. In order to have full correspondence between LiveJournal mood labels and the activation levels of the Hourglass model, moreover, a pool of 21 native English-speaking students was asked to map each of the 130 mood labels into the 24 emotional labels of the Hourglass model. In order to avoid any bias, students were randomly selected among different faculties in the university of Stirling and they were asked to perform the mapping by playing an ad hoc version of the Hour-glass game in a secluded environment. Eventually, a reduced set of 80 moods (those with higher confidence level) was selected for inclusion in the blogpost database. The PatientOpinion dataset, finally, is a manually tagged evaluation resource kindly provided by James Munro, CEO of PatientOpinion, a social enterprise pioneering an online feedback service for users of the UK National Health Service to enable people to share their recent experience of local health services online. It is a collection of 2,000 patient opinions that associates to each post a category (namely, clinical service, communication, food, parking, staff, and timeliness) and a positive
.. or negative polarity. From a first manual evaluation of 50 opinions, the dataset appeared to be 100% accurate. It was used to test the detection of opinion targets and the polarity associated with these. Each of the used datasets has different strengths
.. and weaknesses. The Twitter hashtag repository, for example, is written in very formal English and offers a great span of common knowledge and instances of concepts, but it is rather domain dependent and almost totally lacks the presence of common-sense concepts. The LiveJournal database, in turn, is more open-domain and affective common-sense oriented, but it often contains slang terms and grammatical mistakes, which lower the accuracy of clause chunking and concept parsing. The PatientOpinion database is very well-formed and the most accurate of the three datasets in terms of both affect and category labels, but it is very domain specific and rather limited in number of entries.

Linguagem natural na análise de sentimentos
-------------------------------------------

Modelando a estrutura do discurso, como destrinchar o documentos, contribui para uma análise de sentimentos global mais efetiva. Trabalhos anteriores tentaram direcionar parte do problema incorporalando a localização characteristica de classificação. Estudos mais recendes também reacendem estada discusão de que a posição da informação é particularmente relevante no contexto de sumarização do sentimentos. Em particular, em contraste a sumarização de tópicos, onde o inicio do artigo normalmente serve como patamar, as últimas N sentençás de uma review vem mostrando que servem muito mais para sumarizar o sentimento de um texto, e parece ser tão bom quanto as ultimas N mais subjetivas sentençáß. Pesquisas exploraram como caracteristicas baseadas na relação dependente de sintática pode ser utilizado para melhorar a performace na minerção de opniões. 

.. Modelling discourse structure, such as twists and turns in documents, contributes to a more effective overall sentiment labelling. Early works attempted to partially address this problem via incorporating location information in the feature set [217]. More recent studies have underlined that position is particularly relevant in the context of sentiment summarisation. In particular, in contrast to topic-based text summarisation, where the incipits of articles usually serve as a strong baseline, the last n sentences of a review have been shown to serve as a much better summary of the overall sentiment of the document, and to be almost as good as the n (automatically-computed) most subjective sentences [217]. Joshi and Rose [147], for example, explored how features based on syntactic dependency relations can be utilised to improve performance on opinion mining. Using a transformation of dependency relation triples, they convert them into ‘composite back-off features’ that generalise better than the regular lexicalised dependency relation features.

Porque é tão dificil realizar analise de sentimentos
----------------------------------------------------

Para um olhar leigo, a mineração de opnião e análise de sentimentos de parecer com os mesmo campos da mineração de textos ou análise baseadas em fatos. Ainda mais, desde que a classificação de sentimentos liga com um número relativamente pequeno de classes, pode parecer que é uma tarefa fácil comparada a auto-categorização. A mineração de opnião, no entando, é uma tarefa bem complexa até mesmo em níveis básicos como a classificação de poalridade, que um caso binário. A extração da polaridade de um texto, pode ser realizada comparando palavras extraidas  do texto com um grupo de palavras chaves que possuem valencia positiva (amor, maravilhoso...)  ou valencia negativa (mal, ruim, chato ...), como no caso de avaliação binaria de tópicos. No entanto a identificação de um conjunto de palavras chaves corretos para mineração de opnião não é uma tarefa trivial. Até mesmo quando as técnicas de aprendizagem de máquinas são empregadas para selecionar palavras-chaves de um corpo linguistico de treinamento, em nível de acurácia é ainda muito baixo se comparado na performace de classificação binárias de tópicos. A principal razão é que, diferentemente dos tópicos, sentimentos as vezes são expressados de maneira muito sútil, tornando díficil de ser identificado atŕaves de qualquer sentença quando avaliadas isoladamente.

.. To the inexpert eye, opinion mining and sentiment analysis might look like the same as fields such as traditional text mining or fact-based analysis. Moreover, since sentiment classification deals with a relatively small number of classes, it might look like an easy task compared to text auto-categorisation. Opinion mining, however, is a very complex task even at its more basic level of sentiment polarity classification, which is a case of binary classification. The extraction of opinion polarity from text can be performed by comparing words extracted from text with a set of keywords with positive valence (e.g., love, wonderful, best, great, superb, still, beautiful) and negative valence (e.g., bad, worst, stupid, waste, boring), as in the case of topic based binary classification. The identification of a right set of keywords for mining opinions, however, is not a trivial task. Even when machine learning techniques are employed to select keywords from training corpora, the level of accuracy is still very low if compared to the performance of typical topic-based binary classification [220]. The main reason is that, differently from topics, sentiments can often be expressed in a more subtle manner, making it difficult to be identified by any of a sentence or document’s terms when considered in isolation.

Sabedoria das multidões (WotC, wisdom-of-the-crowds): Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) e outros
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Amazon Mechanical Turk:**

O Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) é um serviço online de micro-trabalhos aonde trabalhadores realizam pequenas tarefas  em troca de uma pequna quantidade de dinheiro.
.. is a micro-labor website where workers perform minor tasks in exchange for a small amount of money.

A qualidade dos dados dentro de técnicas Turk
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Anteriormente experimentos de classificação linguistica utilizaram WotC no AMT em mostraram que fiél - algumas vezes até mesmo superando classificações estado-da-arte. Por outro lado, tais trabalhos alertaram métodos necessários para reduziar a quantidade de ruído dos trabalhos do AMT que podem produzir trabalhos de má qualidade.

Um exeplo usado pelos autores do Vader para garantir a qualidade de seus dados.
	1) Todo avaliador fizeram antes uma leitura compreensiva da Ligua Inglesa - cada avaliador tiveram que tirar uma nota superior a 80% em testes padões de compreensão de leitura no nível colégial.
	2) Todo avaliador tiveram que completar uma orientação e treinamento para classificação de sentimentos e tirar nota acima de 90%. Este avaliador deveria identificar sentimentos em palavras individuais, emoticons, acronimos, sentençás e tweets. O treinamento ajuda a manter a consistencia da classificação para cada avaliador independente.
	3) A cada batida de 35 classificações contendo cinco items de ouro com um sentimento pre avaliado. Se o trabalhador ficasse mais de um desvio padrão fora da média (errasse 3 dos 5 items de ouro), eram discartados toda essa batida do trabalhador.

.. Previous linguistic rating experiments using a WotC approach on AMT have shown to be reliable – sometimes even outperforming expert raters (Snow, O’Connor, Jurafsky, & Ng, 2008). On the other hand, prior work has also advised on methods to reduce the amount of noise from AMT workers who may produce poor quality work (Downs, Holbrook, Sheng, & Cranor, 2010; Kittur, Chi, & Suh, 2008).

.. Example Used By VADER authors to ensure data quality:

.. 1) Every rater was prescreened for English language reading comprehension – each rater had to individually score an 80% or higher on a standardized college-level reading comprehension test.
.. 2) Every prescreened rater then had to complete an online sentiment rating training and orientation session, and score 90% or higher for matching the known (prevalidated) mean sentiment rating of lexical items which included individual words, emoticons, acronyms, sentences, tweets, and text snippets (e.g., sentence segments, or phrases). The user interface employed during the sentiment training (Figure 2) always matched the specific sentiment rating tasks discussed in this paper. The training helped to ensure consistency in the rating rubric used by each independent rater.
.. 3) Every batch of 25 features contained five “golden items” with a known (pre-validated) sentiment rating distribution. If a worker was more than one standard deviation away from the mean of this known distribution on three or more of the five golden items, we discarded all 25 ratings in the batch from this worker.


Finalmente foi implementado um programa de bonus para incentivar e recompensar trabalhos de alta qualidade. Compensar os trabalhadores do AMT 0.25 cents para cada batida de 25 items classificados, com um adicional de 25 centis para todos os trabalhadores que conseguiremficar dentro de 1.5 de desvio padrao em ao menos 20 das 25 respostas. Utilizando estes metodos de controle de qualidade, foi agregado uma confianca maior aos dados obtidos pelo AMT.

.. Finally, implemented a bonus program to incentivize and reward the highest quality work. For example, ask workers to select the valence score that they thought “most other people” would choose for the given lexical feature (early/iterative pilot testing revealed that wording the instructions in this manner garnered a much tighter standard deviation without significantly affecting the mean sentiment rating, allowing us to achieve higher quality (generalized) results while being more economical). Compensate AMT workers $0.25 for each batch of 25 items they rated, with an additional $0.25 incentive bonus for all workers who successfully matched the group mean (within 1.5 standard deviations) on at least 20 of 25 responses in each batch. Using these four quality control
.. methods, achieve remarkable value in the data obtained from AMT workers – pay incentive bonuses for high quality to at least 90% of raters for most batches.

Discussão sobre Polaridade de Sentimentos (Positivo vs Negativo) e Intensidade de sentimentos (Granularidade)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ambas abordagens (Polaridade e Granularidade), ainda estão muito longe de serem capazes de inferir afetivamente e cognitivamente a informação associada com a liguagem natural, pois se baseiam principalmente e bases de dados de conhecimento que ainda estão muito limitadas para processar efetivamente um texto em nivel de sentença. As técnicas para computar o senso comum são desenvolvidas e aplicadas para preencher o gap semantivo entre o nível da palavra natural e do nível de conceito de opniões. Em particular, o conjunto de aplicações para mineração de grafos e técnicas de reducção de multidimensionalidade para dois sensos comuns foram explorados para desenvolver um enovador mecanismo para o dominio da mineração de opniões e analise de sentimentos. A abordagem proposta, chamada computação de sentimentos, realiza uma análise semantica em nível de clasula do texto, o que permite a inferencia ceonceitual e emocional da informação associada com a linguagem natural de opniào e, entao, uma passagem mais eficiente de um texto não estruturado para processavel e estruturado. 

O mecanismo foi testado em tres diferentes recursos, chamado Twitter hashtag repository, o LiveJournal database e o PatienteOpnion dataset, e suas performaces comparadas com dois resultados obtidos utilizando técnicas de analise de sentimentos padrao e utilizando direntes estado-da-arte bases de conhecimento como o WordNet, ConceptNet, Probase. Diferentemente dos serviços atualmente disponiveis para mineracao de opniões, o mecanismo desenvolvido não se baseiam a um limitado grupo de palavras afetivas e a frequencia de coocorrencia, mas no conceito do senso comum e a valencia cognitiva e agetiva. Isto permite que o mecanismo seja idenpedente de dominio, assim, pode ser embutido em qualquer sistema para mineração de opnião para o desenvolvimento de plicações intelifentes em multiplos cmapos como Redes Sociais, HCI, e e-health. Olhando adiante, a combinação a combinação de diferentes vasos de conhecimento e técnicas razoaveis de senso comum para mineração de opnião propuseram eventualmente, permitem pavimentar um caminho para o desenvolvimento de abordagens bio-inspiradas para o a criação de um processamento de linguagem natural capaz de lidar com o conhecimento, recuperando quando necessario, realizando analogias e parendando de experiencia.

Isto é uma indicativa de uma diferença interesante entre tipico categorização de topicos e classificação de polaridade. Enquanto o topico tende a ser enfatizado pela frequencia ocorrente por certas palavras-chaves, em geral sentimentos pode não ser normalmente detectado pela repetição de termos. Outras caracteristicas baseadas nos termos são as vezes adicionadas no vetor de caracteristicas. Posição é uma dessas, em consideração de omo a posição de uma palavra em uma unidade do texto pode afetar a forma em que esta palavra afeta o sentimento deste texto. Tambem a presenca de n0gramas, tipicamente bigrama e trigrama, são normalmente tomadas em considração como caracteristicas uteis. Alguns metodos tambem ss ebaseiam na distancia dos termos. A informação gramatical (substantivos, adjetivos, adverbios, verbos, etc.) é normalmente explorada na analise geral de um texto assim como a desambiguação das palavras. Certos adjetivos, em particular, vem sendo procados como bom indicadores de sentimentos e algumas vezes são utilizados para guiar a classificação do sentimento. Em alguns trabalhos, eventualmente, a detecção do sentimento foi realizada por frases selecionadas, as quais fora preselecionadas pelo numero especificos de pafradoes da gramatica, a maioria incluindo adjetivos ou adverbios. Todas as abordagens se baseiam principalmente em partes do texto onde opnião e sentimentos são expressados explicitamente, polaridade de termos, lpalavras afeticas e a coocorrencia de frequencia. Opiniões e sentimentos, no entando, são normalmente contidas implicitamente pelo contexto e dependem de conceitos, o que faz com que abordagens puramente sintaticas sejam ineficientes.

.. These approaches, however, are still far from being able to infer the cognitive and affective information associated with natural language as they mainly rely on knowledge bases that are still too limited to efficiently process text at sentence level. In this book, common-sense computing techniques are further developed and applied to bridge the semantic gap between word-level natural language data and the concept-level opinions conveyed by these. In particular, the ensemble application of graph mining and multi-dimensionality reduction techniques on two common-sense knowledge bases was exploited to develop a novel intelligent engine for open-domain opinion mining and sentiment analysis. The proposed approach, termed sentic computing, performs a clause-level semantic analysis of text, which allows the inference of both the conceptual and emotional information associated with natural language opinions and, hence, a more efficient passage from (unstructured) textual information to (structured) machine-processable data. 

.. The engine was tested on three different resources, namely a Twitter hashtag repository, a LiveJournal database, and a PatientOpinion dataset, and its performance compared both with results obtained using standard sentiment analysis techniques and using different state-of-the-art knowledge bases such as Princeton’s WordNet, MIT’s ConceptNet, and Microsoft’s Probase. Differently from most currently available opinion mining services, the developed engine does not base its analysis on a limited set of affect words and their co-occurrence frequencies, but rather on common-sense concepts and the cognitive and affective valence conveyed by these. This allows the engine to be domain-independent and, hence, to be embedded in any opinion mining system for the development of intelligent applications in multiple fields such as Social Web, HCI, and e-health. Looking ahead, the combined novel use of different knowledge bases and of common-sense reasoning techniques for opinion mining proposed in this work, will, eventually, pave the way for development of more bio-inspired approaches to the design of natural language processing systems capable of handling knowledge, retrieving it when necessary, making analogies, and learning from experience.

.. This is indicative of an interesting difference between typical topic-based text categorisation and polarity classification. While a topic is more likely to be emphasised by frequent occurrences of certain keywords, overall sentiment may not usually be highlighted through repeated use of the same terms. Other term-based features are often added to the features vector. Position is one of these, in consideration of how the position of a token in a text unit can affect the way in which the token affect the sentiment of the text. Also presence n-grams, typically bi-grams and tri-grams, are often taken into account as useful features. Some methods also rely on the distance between terms. Part of speech (POS) information (nouns, adjectives, adverbs, verbs, etc.) is also commonly exploited in general textual analysis as a basic form of word sense disambiguation [303]. Certain adjectives, in particular, have been proved to be good indicators of sentiment and sometimes have been used to guide feature selection for sentiment classification. In other works, eventually, the detection of sentiments was performed through selected phrases, which were chosen via a number of pre-specified POS patterns, most including an adjective or an adverb [286]. All such approaches mainly rely on parts of text in which opinions and sentiments are explicitly expressed, e.g., polarity terms, affect words, and their co-occurrence frequencies. Opinions and sentiments, however, are often conveyed implicitly through context and domain dependent concepts, which make purely syntactical approaches ineffective.

Lexicos de Sentimentos baseados em valencia (intensidade)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Muitas aplicações se beneficiariam se forem capazes de não somente determinar a polaridade binaria (positive versus negative), mas tambem a força de um sentimento expressado no texto. O quanto favoravel ou desfavoravel as pessoas sentem por um novo produto, filme, ou lei? Analistas e pesquisadores querem (e precisam) ser capazes de reconhecer mudanças na intensidade do sentimento ao longo do tempo com o proposito detectar o tom de aquecimento ou esfriamento de um tema. Desta forma é entendivel que ter um lexico generico com a forças valências seria muito benefico.

.. Many applications would benefit from being able to determine not just the binary polarity (positive versus negative), but also the strength of the sentiment expressed in text. Just how favorably or unfavorably do people feel about a new product, movie, or legislation bill? Analysts and researchers want (and need) to be able to recognize changes in sentiment intensity over time in order to detect when rhetoric is heating up or cooling down (Wilson, Wiebe, & Hwa, 2004). It stands to reason that having a general lexicon with strength valences would be beneficial.

O Léxico Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW) prove um conjunto de classificações emocionais de 1034 palavras em ingles. Diferentemente do LIWC ou do GI, as palavras no ANEW foram rankeadas em termos de praser, exitação e dominância. A palavras do ANEW possuem um ponto de valencia associadas ao sentimento variando de 1 a 9 (com neutro no 5), desta forma palavras com valencia menores do 5 são consideradas desagradaveis/negativas, e aquelas com pontos maiores do que 5 são consideradas agradaveis/positivas. Por exemplo, a valencia para "triar" é 1.68, "brando" é 4.01, "sonho"  é 6.73, "delícia" é 8.26. Estas valencia ajuda os pesquisadores a medir a intensidade dos sentimentos expressados em microblogs, sendo uma dimensão importante além da simples orientação binária positiva ou negativa.

.. The Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW) lexicon provides a set of normative emotional ratings for 1,034 English words (Bradley & Lang, 1999). Unlike LIWC or GI, the words in ANEW have been ranked in terms of their pleasure, arousal, and dominance. ANEW words have an associated sentiment valence ranging from 1-9 (with a neutral midpoint at five), such that words with valence scores less than five are considered unpleasant/negative, and those with scores greater than five are considered pleasant/positive. For example, the valence for betray is 1.68, bland is 4.01, dream is 6.73, and delight is 8.26. These valences help researchers measure the intensity of expressed sentiment in microblogs (De Choudhury, Counts, et al., 2013; De Choudhury, Gamon, et al., 2013; Nielsen, 2011) – an important dimension beyond simple binary orientations of positive and negative.

Sentiwordnet

Visão Geral:
""""""""""""

O Léxico do SentiWordNet é uma extenção do WordNet (em que 147306 synsets foram rotulados com três classificações numericas relacionadas a positividade, negatividade e objetividade). Cada valor varia de 0 a 1, com a suma de 1 para cada synset. O valor foi calculado utilizando uma complexa mistura de algoritimos semi-supervisionados (Propagação de metodos e classificadores). O Léxico do SentiWordNet não faz parte daqueles recursos padrões de ouro como o WordNet, LIWC, GI ou ANEW (os quais foram desenvolvidos 100% por humanos), mas é util para uma grande variedade de tarefas. Você pode interfaciar com o SentiWordNet pelo Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) e utilizar a diferenca do valor de positividade e negatividade de cada synset para como a valencia do sentimento associado a palavra. O Léxico do SentiWordNet possui bastante ruido de firna que uma vasta maioria dos snsets não possuem polaridade positiva ou negativa.

.. SentiWordNet is an extension of WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) in which 147,306 synsets are annotated with three numerical scores relating to positivity, negativity, and objectivity (neutrality) (Baccianella, Esuli, & Sebastiani, 2010). Each score ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, and their sum is 1.0 for each synset. The scores were calculated using a complex mix of semi-supervised algorithms (propagation methods and classifiers). It is thus not a gold standard resource like WordNet, LIWC, GI, or ANEW (which were all 100% curated by humans), but it is useful for a wide range of tasks. You can interface with SentiWordNet via Python’s Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), and use the difference of each sysnset’s positive and negative scores as its sentiment valence to distinguish differences in the sentiment intensity of words. The SentiWordNet lexicon is very noisy; a large majority of synsets have no positive or negative polarity. 

Metodologia
"""""""""""

O SENTIWORDNET v1, é um recurso lexico em que cada synset do WordNet v2 é associado a três valores númericos Obj(s), Pos(s) e Neg(s), descrevendo o quanto objetivo, positivo ou negativo um synset é.  É assumido que que os diferentes sentimentos de um determinado termo pode ter propriedades relacionadas a opnião. Cada um dos três valores varia de 0 a 1 e asoma é 1 para cada synset. Isto significa que um synset não pode ter valor 0 para todas as categrias, o que indica que o synset precisa estar ao menos em uma das categorias. Por exemplo, o synset estimavel da frase (pode ser computado ou estimada) possui objetividade 1 e pos e neg 0, enquanto o synset estimavel (merece respeito) possui positividade 0.75, negatividade 0 e objetividade 0.25.

O método utilizado para gerar o SentiWordNet é vaseado em trabalhos anteriores relacionados a determinar as propriedades da opnião em termos. O metodo se baseia na analise quantitativa das interpretações associadas aos synsets, e na utilização do resultado vetorial da classificação semi-supervisionadas dos termos. Os tres scores são derivados da combinações dos resultadas produzidades por um comite de outo classificadores ternarios, cada um demostrearam, em testes anteriores, acuracia parecida mas um comportamento de classificação distintos.

.. SENTIWORDNET (version 1.0), a lexical resource in which each synset of WORDNET (version 2.0) is associated to three numerical scores Obj(s), P os(s) and Neg(s), describing how Objective, Positive, and Negative the terms contained in the synset are. The assumption that underlies our switch from terms to synsets is that different senses of the same term may have different opinion-related properties. Each of the three scores ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, and their sum is 1.0 for each synset. This means that a synset may have nonzero scores for all the three categories, which would indicate that the corresponding terms have, in the sense indicated by the synset, each of the three opinion-related properties only to a certain degree1 . For example, the synset [estimable(3)]2
.. , corresponding to the sense “may be computed or estimated” of the adjective estimable, has an Obj score of 1.0 (and P os and Neg scores of 0.0), while the synset [estimable(1)] corresponding to the sense “deserving of respect or high regard” has a P os score of 0.75, a Neg score of 0.0, and an Obj score of 0.25. 

.. The method we have used to develop SENTIWORDNET is based on our previous work on determining the opinionrelated properties of terms (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006). The method relies on the quantitative analysis of the glosses associated to synsets, and on the use of the resulting vectorial term representations for semi-supervised synset classification. The three scores are derived by combining the results produced by a committee of eight ternary classifiers, each of which has demonstrated, in our previous tests, similar accuracy but different characteristics in terms of classification behaviour.

O método utilizado para desenvolver o SentiWordNet é uma adaptação para a classificação dos synset de método utilizado para decidir a polaridade e a objetividade de temros. O método apoia no treinamento de um conjunto de classificadores ternarios, em cada um capaz de tecidir se o synset é positivo, negativo ou objetivo. Cada classificador ternario difere entre si no conjunto de treinamento utilizado e no mecanimos de aprendizado utilizaado, desta forma produzindo diferentes resultados para a classificação dos synsets do WordNet. Valores relacionados a opnião para cada synset são determinados pela proporção normalizada dos classificadores ternarios atribuidas ao rotulo correspondente. Se todos os calssificadores concordam com o rotulo atribuido ao synset, este rotulo téra o valor maximo para aquele synset, de outra forma cada rotulo té um valor proporcional ao número de classificações atribuidos.

.. The method we have used to develop SENTIWORDNET is an adaptation to synset classification of our method for deciding the PN-polarity (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005) and SOpolarity (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) of terms. The method relies on training a set of ternary classifiers3 , each of them capable of deciding whether a synset is Positive, or Negative, or Objective. Each ternary classifier differs from the other in the training set used to train it and in the learning device used to train it, thus producing different classification results of the WORDNET synsets. Opinion-related scores for a synset are determined by the (normalized) proportion of ternary classifiers that have assigned the corresponding label to it. If all the ternary classifiers agree in assigning the same label to a synset, that label will have the maximum score for that synset, otherwise each label will have a score proportional to the number of classifiers that have assigned it.

** Treinando um classificador **
	
	Cada classificador ternário é gerado utilizando metodos semisupervisionados. Um método semi-supervisionado é um processo de aprendizagem onde um pequeno subcoonjunto de dados para treinamento foram manualmente rotulados. No inicio os dados para treinamento não eram rotulados, é o processo por ele mesmo que os rotula automaricamente, utilizando o pequeno subconjunto já rotulado como entrada. O método define que este subconjunto ja rotulado como a união de tres conjuntos sementes Lp, Ln, Lo da positividade, negatividade e objetividade dos synsets respectivamente.

.. Each ternary classifier is generated using the semisupervised method described in (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006). A semi-supervised method is a learning process whereby only a small subset L ⊂ T r of the training data T r have been manually labelled. In origin the training data in U = T r −L were instead unlabelled; it is the process itself that has labelled them, automatically, by using L (with the possible addition of other publicly available resources) as input. Our method defines L as the union of three seed (i.e.training) sets Lp, Ln and Lo of known Positive, Negative and Objective synsets, respectively4.
	
	Lp e Ln são pequenos conjuntos, que foram definidos manualmente. Lp e Ln foram expandidos interativamente, em K interações, para formar o conjunto de treiamento final. A cada interação Lp e Ln é um subconjunto do proximo Lp e Ln. A expansão em cada passo consiste em:
		1) Se ambos forem classificados como positivo pelo classificador precedente e classificado como não negativo pelo proximo classificador são julgados como positivo.
		2) E termos que foram classificados ambos como não positivo pelo classificador precedente e negativo paelo classificador posterior será julgado como negativo.
		3) Os termos que foram classificadors tanto como primeiro negativo e depois positivo ou primeiro positivo e depois negativo é considerado como objetivo. 
		   
	O resultado do classificardor ternario é aplicado ao vetor que representado todos os synsets do Wordnet para produzir uma classificação sentimentao de todo o WordNet.

.. Lp and Ln are two small sets, which we have defined by manually selecting the intended synsets5 for 14 “paradigmatic” Positive and Negative terms (e.g. the Positive term nice, the Negative term nasty) which were used as seed terms in (Turney and Littman, 2003). Lp and Ln are then iteratively expanded, in K iterations, into the final training sets T rK p and T rK n . At each iteration step k two sets T rk p and T rk n are generated, where T rk p ⊃ T rk−1 p ⊃ . . . ⊃ T r1 p = Lp and T rk n ⊃ T rk−1 n ⊃ . . . ⊃ T r1 n = Ln. The expansion at iteration step k consists been classified both into Positive by the former classifier and into (not Negative) by the latter are deemed to be positive, and terms that have been classified both into (not Positive) by the former classifier and into Negative by the latter are deemed to be negative. The terms that have been classified (i) into both (not Positive) and (not Negative), or (ii) into both Positive and Negative, are taken to be Objective.In the training phase, the terms in T rK n ∪ T rK o are used as training examples of category (not Positive), and the terms in T rK p ∪ T rK o are used as training examples of category (not Negative). The resulting ternary classifier Φˆ is then applied to the vectorial representations of all WORDNET synsets (including those in T rK − L), to produce the sentiment classification of the entire WORDNET.

** Definindo o comite de classificadores **

	Em algumas pesquias foram apontados como diferentes conjuntos de combinação de conjuntos para treinamento e métodos de apredizagem possuem uma performace diferente, mesmo que tais metodos diferentes apresentem acuracia similar. O as principais observações que valem a pena serem lembradas são:
		1. Valores baixos para K produz pequenos conjuntos de treinamento para Positivo e Negativo, os quais produzem classificadores binarios com baixo abrangência e alta precisão para estas categorias. Aumentando K estes conjuntos crescem, e o efeito de ter estes grandes grupos é aumentar a abrangencia, mas tambem aumentar o ruido do conjunto para treinamento, diminuindo a precisão.
		2. Métodos de aprendizagem que utilizam informação a prior de uma probabilidade da categoria, por exemplo, técnicas de Naive Bayesian e SVMs, que estimam estas probabilidades do conjunto de treinamentos, são sensíveis para a relativa cardinalidade do conjunto de treinamento, e tendem a classificar mais items na categoria que possuem mais items de treinamentos positivos. Técnicas que não utilizam este tipo de informação, como Rocchio, não apresenzando este tipo de comportamento.
		3.  A varieabilidade descrita in pontos anterioes não afeta acurácia geral de um método, mas apenas balanceia a classificação entre items subjetios e objetivos, enquanto a acurácia da discrimação entre items positivos e negativos tende a ser constante.

.. In (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) we point out how different combinations of training set and learner perform differently, even though with similar accuracy. The main three observations we recall here are the following:

.. • Low values of K produce small training sets for Positive and Negative, which produces binary classifiers with low recall and high precision for these categories. By increasing K these sets get larger, and the effect of these larger numbers is to increase recall and but to also add “noise” to the training set, which decreases precision.

.. • Learners that use information about the prior probabilities of categories, e.g. naive Bayesian learners and SVMs, which estimate these probabilities from the training sets, are sensitive to the relative cardinalities of the training sets, and tend to classify more items into the categories that have more positive training items. Learners that do not use this kind of information, like Rocchio, do not exhibit this kind of behaviour. 

.. • The variability described in the previous points does not affect the overall accuracy of the method, but only the balance in classification between Subjective and Objective items, while the accuracy in discriminating between Positive and Negative items tends to be constant.

Seguindo estas considerações, foi decidido combinar diferntes configurações do conjunto de treinamento e as técnicas de aprendizagem do comite, para produzir os valores vinais do SentiWordNet. Especificamente, foram definidos 4 diferentes frupos de treinamento, escolhendo 4 valores diferentes para K (0, 2, 4, 6), e alternadamente foram usados dois classificadores (Rocchio e SVM's), desta forma adiquire-se um total de 8 classificadores ternarios. Com k=0 e com o SVM foram obtidas classificações bastante conservativa para positivo e negativo, com baixa abrangencia e alta precisão. Para k = 6 e SVM foram produzidos resultados mais liberais para a classificação binaria que classifica os sunsets como positivo ou negativo mesmo com presençá baixa de subjetividade. O classificador baseado em Rocchio obteve comportamento similiar, mesmo não depentendo de uma classificação a prior da probabilidade de uma categoria. O SentiWordNet foi então obtido a partir da combinação, para cada synset, dos valores obtidos da classificação ternaria dos 8 métodos e então normalizado para 1.

.. Following these considerations, we have decided to combine different configurations of training set and learner nto a committee, to produce the final SENTIWORDNET scores. Specifically, we have defined four different training sets, by choosing four different values of K (0, 2, 4, 6), and we have alternatively used two learners (Rocchio and SVMs)6 ; this yields a total of eight ternary classifiers. With K = 0 and the SVM learner we have obtained very “conservative” binary classifier for Positive and Negative, with very low recall and high precision. For K = 6 SVMs produced instead “liberal” binary classifiers for these two labels, that classify many synsets as Positive or Negative even in the presence of very little evidence of subjectivity. The Rocchio learner has a similar behaviour, although not dependent on the prior probabilities of categories. SENTIWORDNET is thus obtained
.. by combining, for each synset, the scores produced by the eight ternary classifiers and normalizing them to 1.0.

SenticNet
"""""""""

Visão Geral
"""""""""""

O SenticNet é um recurso semantico e afetivo disponivel ao publico para a analise de sentimentos e opnião em nível de conceito. 
Senticnet foi construido por meios da computação de sentimentos, um paradifma que explora juntamente AI e Técnicas da Web Semantica para realizar o processamento de linguagem natural e extrair opniões, a partir, de uma montagem de técinicas de grafos em mineração de dados e redução de dimensionalidade. O Léxico SenticNet consistem em 14.244 conceitos do senso comum como ira, adoração, aflição e admiração com a informação associada com o conceito de polaridade de sentimento, um valor numerico em uma escala continua de -1 a 1.

O SenticNet 2 é um recurso disponivel para mineracoa de opniao que explora AI e técnicas da Web semantiva para inferir a polaridade assiciada com conceitos do senso comum e representa em umf formato semantico onciente. Em particular, SenticNet utiliza redução de dimensionalide para calcular  a valencia afetiva de um conjunto de conceitos do Open Mind e representa de forma acessivel e processavel para maquinas. O resultado é uma base de conhecimento disponivel para mineração de opnião a partir da linguagem natural do seu texto até sua semantica, ao inves de somente analisar em nivel sintatico.

.. SenticNet is a publicly available semantic and affective resource for concept-level opinion and sentiment analysis (Cambria, Havasi, & Hussain, 2012). SenticNet is constructed by means of sentic computing, a paradigm that exploits both AI and Semantic Web techniques to process natural language opinions via an ensemble of graph-mining and dimensionality-reduction techniques (Cambria, Speer, Havasi, & Hussain, 2010). The SenticNet lexicon consists of 14,244 common sense concepts such as wrath, adoration,
.. woe, and admiration with information associated with (among other things) the concept’s sentiment polarity, a numeric value on a continuous scale ranging from –1 to 1.

.. SenticNet 2 [60] is a publicly available resource for opinion mining that exploits both AI and Semantic Web techniques to infer the polarity associated with commonsense concepts and represent it in a semantic-aware format. In particular, SenticNet uses dimensionality reduction to calculate the affective valence of a set of Open Mind concepts and represent it in a machine-accessible and machine-processable format. The result is a publicly available knowledge base (also accessible through an API 3 ) for mining opinions from natural language text at a semantic, rather than just syntactic, level. This section shows motivations and techniques for building such a resource and encode it in a Semantic Web aware format (section 4.1.1), in order to be exploited for NLP tasks (section 4.1.2).

Metodologia
"""""""""""

O desenvolvido do SenticNet doi inspirado pelo SentiWordNet, um recurso lexico que para cada snset do WordNet associal a tres valores numericos distribuidos em o quao objetivo, positivo ou negativo os termos do synset são. Em cada uma das tres categorias abrangendo de 0 a 1 em que a soma de todas desse 1. Isto significa que um synset não possui valor 0 para todos as tres categorias, de tal forma indica que cada termo do synset possui em certo grau opnião relacionada a propriedade de cada categoria.

.. The development of SenticNet was inspired by SentiWordNet [104], a lexical resource in which each WordNet synset is associated to three numerical scores describing how objective, positive and negative the terms contained in the synset are. Each of the three scores ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 and their sum is 1.0 for each synset. This means that a synset may have non-zero scores for all the three categories, which would indicate that the corresponding terms have, in the sense indicated by the synset, each of the three opinion-related properties only to a certain degree.

O método utilizado para desenvolver o SentiWordNet é baseado na analise quantitativa das "interpretações" associadaes para os synsets e na utilização resultante de representações vetoriais para classificação semi-supervisionado dos synset. Os tres valores são derivados da cominação de diferentes resultados  obtidos pelo comite de 8 classificadores ternarios, todos os classificadores com niveis de acuracia similar mas com metodos de classificação diferentes. O SentiWordNet atualmente representa um bom recurso para mineracao de opnião, no entanto, ele contem muito ruido e praticamente prove polaridade em apenas nivel sintatico, deixado de lado a informação de conhecimento do senso comum, conceitos, como "mal precentimento", "estar nas nuvens", "celebrar ocasiao especial", conceitos os quais são normalmente encontrados na linguagem natural nos textos para expressar pontos de vistas positivos e negativos. E foi para esse fim que o SenticNet foi desenvolvido.


.. The method used to develop SentiWordNet is based on the quantitative analysis of the ‘glosses’ associated to synsets and on the use of the resulting vector representations for semi-supervised synset classification. The three scores are derived by combining the results produced by a committee of eight ternary classifiers, all characterised by similar accuracy levels but different classification behaviour. SentiWordNet currently represents a good resource for opinion mining, however, it contains a lot of noise and it mainly provides opinion polarity at syntactical level, leaving out polarity information for common-sense knowledge concepts such as ‘accomplish goal’, ‘bad feeling’, ‘celebrate special occasion’, ‘lose temper’, or ‘be on cloud nine’, which are usually found in natural language text to express positive and negative viewpoints. To this end, SenticNet was developed (Fig. 4.1).

Senticnet vs SentiWordNet
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

Diferentemente do SentiWordNet (em que tambem se inclui a polaridade nula dos termos), de fato, SenticNet não contem coneitos como neutro ou polaridade quase neutram assim conceitos com polaridade de magnetude quase zero. Além disso, enquanto o SentiWordNet guarda os tres valores para cada synset, o SenticNet para cada coceito C é associado a apenas um valor, um ponto flutuante de [-1 a 1] representando sua polaridade, a fim de evitar redundancia e assim representar o SenticNet como uma rede semantiva. Desta forma, dentro do SenticNet, conceitos como "dar uma boa impressao", "olhar atrativo", "bom negocio" são comumente associados a ter valores perto de 1, enquanto conceitos como "ser demitido", "deixar para tras", comumente possuem prolaridade perdo de -1. Os valores de polaridade são associados aos conceitos do Open Mind para por meio de Ativação de Sebtunebtis. Em particular os níveis sintaticos do modelo Hourglass são utilziados como conceitos de entradas para os niveis U, o qual utiliza uma intuição digital para inferir semanticamente e afetivamente os conceitos relacionados. É utilizado a exploração da associação espectral para ativar coneitos atraves de estruturas de grafos do AffectNet.

.. Differently from SentiWordNet (which also includes null polarity terms), in fact, SenticNet does not contain concepts with neutral or almost neutral polarity, i.e., concepts with polarity magnitude close to zero. Moreover, while SentiWordNet stores three values for each synset, in SenticNet each concept c is associated to just one value p c , i.e., a float 2 [-1,1] representing its polarity, in order to avoid redundancy and more easily represent SenticNet as a semantic network. Therefore, in SenticNet, concepts like ‘make good impression’, ‘look attractive’, ‘show appreciation’, or ‘good deal’ are likely to have p c very close to 1, while concepts such as ‘being fired’, ‘leave behind’, or ‘lose control’ are likely to have p c -1. Polarity values are assigned to Open Mind concepts by means of Sentic Activation. In particular, the sentic levels of the Hourglass model are used as input concepts for the U-level, which uses its digital intuition to infer semantically and affectively related concepts. Such seed concepts then crop out to the C-level that exploits spectral association to accordingly spread their activation through the graph structure of AffectNet.

Lexicos e seu contexto
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Quando alguem utiliza lexicos binarios baseados em polaridade ou lexicos basiados na valencia, é possível melhor a performace da  analise de sentimentos entendendo profundamente as propriedades lexicas (como parte do  discurso) para um contexto mais conciente. Por exemplo, um Lexico pode ser calibrado de certa forma para processar desambiguação do sentido da palavra. A desambiguição do sentido da palavra refere ao processo de indentificar que sentido da palavra é utilizada na sentença quando a palavra possui muitos sentidos (sentido dentro do contexto). 

.. Whether one is using binary polarity-based lexicons or more nuanced valence-based lexicons, it is possible to improve sentiment analysis performance by understanding deeper lexical properties (e.g., parts-of-speech) for more context awareness. For example, a lexicon may be further tuned according to a process of word-sense disambiguation (WSD) (Akkaya, Wiebe, & Mihalcea, 2009). Word-sense disambiguation refers to the process of identifying which sense of a word is used in a sentence when the word has multiple meanings (i.e. its contextual meaning). For example, using WSD, we can distinguish that the word catch has negative sentiment in “At first glance the contract looks good, but there’s a catch”, but is neutral in “The fisherman plans to sell his catch at the market”.

Dominio Lavo
------------

Apesar da ubiquidade para avaliação de sentimentos em contexto de midias sociais, existem geralmente tres deficiencias das analises de sentimentos baseadas em lexicos:
	1) Possuem problemas em cobrir, as vezes ignoram caracteristicas lexicas importantes, as quais são especialmente relevantes para textos sociais.
	2) Alguns lexicos ignoram a intensidade do sentimento geral para as caracteristicas dentro do lexico.
	3) Adiquindo um novo conjunto de caracteristicas lexicas, com seu sentimento e valencia associados, pode consumir muito tempo e trabalho intenso.

.. Despite their ubiquity for evaluating sentiment in social media contexts, there are generally three shortcomings of lexicon-based sentiment analysis approaches: 
.. 	1) They have trouble with coverage, often ignoring important lexical features which are especially relevant to social text in microblogs
.. 	2) Some lexicons ignore general sentiment intensity differentials for features within the lexicon
.. 	3) Acquiring a new set of (human validated gold standard) lexical features – along with their associated sentiment valence scores – can be a very time consuming and labor intensive process. 

Léxicos orientado a Semantica (Baseados em Polaridade, Positiva vs Negativa)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AffectNet
---------

A base de afetivos do senso comum desenvolvida pelos autores deste metodos foi construida sobre o ConcepNet, a representação em grafo do corpus do Open Mind, que é estruturalmente similar ao WordNet, mas o escopo do conhecimento é conhecimento global. Ao inves de insistir em formalizar as razoes do senso comum utilizando logica matematica, o ConceptNet utiliza uma nova abordagem: ele representa dados em forma de uma rede semantica e a torna disponivel para ser utilizada no processamento de linguagem natural. A prerrogativa do ConceptNet, é de vato, sua razão de senso comum conetextual: Enquanto o WordNet é optimizado para categorizar os lexicos e de determinar a similaridade de uma palavra, o ConceptNet é optimizado para tornar pratico a inferencia do contexto baseado em textos do mundo real. Dentro do ConceptNet, a notação de nodo do WordNet é extendida de puramente items lexicos (palavras e frases simples com sentido atomico) para incluir conceitos compostos de alta ordem, por exemplo, "satifazer a fome", "seguir a receita", representa conhecimento em volta de um amplo extensão de conceitos encontradas da vida do dia a dia. Ainda mais, o repertorio do WordNet de relações semanticas é extendido do triplet de synonymos, IsA e PartOf, para o repertorio de 20 relacoes semanticas incluido, por exemplo, EffectOf, SubeventOf, CapableOf, MotivationOf, PropertyOf, and LocarionOf. O ConceptNet é tambem mais informal, reversivel, praticamente avalidado naturalmente.

.. The affective common-sense knowledge base developed within this research work is built upon ConceptNet [181], the graph representation of the Open Mind corpus, which structurally similar to WordNet, but whose scope of contents is general world knowledge, in the same vein as Cyc. Instead of insisting on formalising common sense reasoning using mathematical logic [204], ConceptNet uses a new approach: it represents data in the form of a semantic network and makes it available to be used in natural language processing. The prerogative of ConceptNet, in fact, is contextual common-sense reasoning: while WordNet is optimised for lexical categorisation and word-similarity determination, and Cyc is optimised for formalised logical reasoning, ConceptNet is optimised for making practical context-based inferences over real-world texts. In ConceptNet, WordNet’s notion of node in the semantic network is extended from purely lexical items (words and simple phrases with atomic meaning) to include higher-order compound concepts, e.g., ‘satisfy hunger’ and ‘follow recipe’, to represent knowledge around a greater range of concepts found in everyday life (Table 3.1). Moreover WordNet’s repertoire of semantic relations is extended from the triplet of synonym, IsA and PartOf, to a repertoire of twenty semantic relations including, for example, EffectOf (causality), SubeventOf (event hierarchy), CapableOf (agent’s ability), MotivationOf (affect), PropertyOf, and LocationOf. ConceptNet’s knowledge is also of a more informal, defeasible,and practically valued nature.

LIWC

Visão Geral

Psicologos, linguistas, cientistas da computação e sociologos gostam do LIWC pelo fato de set um dataset extensivamente validado. Além disso, é um dicionário integro e sua lista de palavras é facilmente especionada, entendida, e extendida se desejado. Tais atribuitos fazem o LIWC uma opção atrativa para pesquisadores que procuram um lexico confiavel para extrair a emoção ou a polaridade do sentimento de um texto. O LIWC é um software de analise de texto destinado a estudar os diversos componentes emocionais, cognitivos ou estruturais presentes em a amostra de texto. O LIWC utiliza para este fim um dicionario proprietario de quase 4500 palavras organizadas em uma (ou mais) das 76 categorias, incluindo 905 palavras em duas categorias especiamente relacionadas a analise de sentimentos. LIWC é bem estaelecido e vem sendo internalmente e externalmente validado em um processo que percorre mais de uma decada de trabalho por psicologos, sociologos, e linguistas. O seu pedifree e validação torna o LIWC uma opção atrativa para pesquisadores que estão procurando por um lexico confiavel para extração emocional ou de polaridade de um texto de media social. Por exemplo, O lexico do LIWC vem sendo utilizado para extrair indicações de sentimentos politicos de um tweet, medida discreta da alegria nacional baseado na atualização do statusdo facebook,  a diferença entre csais romantigos felizes dos infelizes baseadasna comunicação de mensagens instantaneas.

.. Sociologists, psychologists, linguists, and computer scientists find LIWC appealing because it has been extensively validated. Also, its straightforward dictionary and simple word lists are easily inspected, understood, and extended if desired. Such attributes make LIWC an attractive option to researchers looking for a reliable lexicon to extract emotional or sentiment polarity from text. LIWC is text analysis software designed for studying the various emotional, cognitive, structural, and process components

As ferramenta de analise de sentimentos que utilizam o LIWC iria dar o valor igualmente(já que ambos contem termos positivos). Estas distinções são intuitivamente valiosas para uma fina análise de sentimentos.	

Also, LIWC is unable to account for differences in the sentiment intensity of words. For example, “The food here is exceptional” conveys more positive intensity than “The food here is okay”. A sentiment analysis tool using LIWC would score them equally (they each contain one positive term). Such distinctions are intuitively valuable for fine-grained sentiment analysis.

Aprendizado de Maquinas
***********************

Devido ao vato da criação e validação manual de léxicos de sentimentos ser um trabalho intensivo, diversas pesquisas vem explorando meios automaticos de identificar caracteristicas relevantes ao sentimento no texto. Tipicamente praticas estado-da-arte incorporam abordagens de aprendizado de maquina para "aprender" a relevancia do sentimento contido no dexto.

As abordagens com aprendizado de máquina não vem sem desvantagens:
	1) A necessidade de dados para treinamento, com lexicos previamente validados, algumas vezes é problematico adquirir.
	2) Há uma dependencia de que os dados para treinamento representem o maior numero de detalhes possiveis (o que acontece as vezes no caso de textos de medias sociais não serem abrangidos)
	3) Normalmente é computacionalmente caro em termos de processamento da CPI, memoria, para o tempo de treinamento/classidica mão (o que restringe a capacidade de acessar o sentimento em dados streaming).
	4) Normalmente algumas caracteristicas são derivadas atras dos panis dentreo de uma caixa preta que não é facilmente interpretavel por seres e desta forma são mais dificeis de generalizar, modificar ou extender (para outros dominios por exemplo).


.. Because manually creating and validating a comprehensive sentiment lexicon is labor and time intensive, much work has explored automated means of identifying sentimentrelevant features in text. Typical state of the art practices incorporate machine learning approaches to “learn” the sentiment-relevant features of text. 

.. Machine learning approaches are not without drawbacks. 
.. 	1) They require (often extensive) training data which are, as with validated sentiment lexicons, sometimes troublesome to acquire.
.. 	2) They depend on the training set to represent as many features as possible (which often, they do not – especially in the case of the short, sparse text of social media).
.. 	3) They are often more computationally expensive in terms of CPU processing, memory requirements, and training/classification time (which restricts the ability to assess sentiment on streaming data). 
.. 	4) They often derive features “behind the scenes” inside of a black box that is not (easily) human interpretable and are therefore more difficult to either generalize,modify, or extend (e.g., to other domains).

Certos metodos não supervisionados de aprendizagem se baseiam na criação de um lexico de sentimentos de forma não supervisionada e depois é determinado o grau de poisitivdade (ou subjetividade) da unidade do texto. O componente crucial é portanto a criação de um lexico via rotulacao não supervisionada de palavras ou frases com o sentimento de polaridade ou subjetividade. Este lexico pode ser usado para identificar a prior a polaridade ou subjetividade dos termos our frases, para usar futuramente na identificação da polaridade e subjetividade contexto. Os primeiros trabalhos eram principalmente baseados na heuristica linguistica. Por exemplo, uma pesquisa aponta que no caso da classificação de polaridade, as duas classes representam interesse opostos, e restrições opostas podem ajudar nas decisões de rotulação.

.. Several unsupervised learning approaches rely on the creation of a sentiment lexicon in an unsupervised manner that is later used to determine the degree of positivity (or subjectivity) of a text unit. The crucial component is, therefore, the creation of the
.. lexicon via the unsupervised labelling of words or phrases with their sentiment polarity or subjectivity [219]. This lexicon can be used to identify the prior polarity or the prior subjectivity of terms or phrases, to use towards further identifying contextual polarity or subjectivity. Early works were mainly based on linguistic heuristics. For example, Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown’s technique [129] was built on the fact that, in the case of polarity classification, the two classes of interest represent opposites, and ‘opposition constraints’ can be used to help labelling decisions.

Naive Bayes
^^^^^^^^^^^

O classificador de Naive Bayes (NB) é um classificador que se baseia na probabilidade Bayesiana e a suposição de Naive que as caracteristicas das probabilidades são independentes uma de outra.

.. The Naive Bayes (NB) classifier is a simple classifier that relies on Bayesian probability and the naive assumption that feature probabilities are independent of one another. 

Entropia Maxima
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A entropia máxima (MaxEnt, ou ME) é uma técnica de uso geral para aprendizado de máquina que pertence a classe de modelos exponeciaisque utilizam Logica de Regressão Multinominal. Diferentemente de NB, ME não supoem que há uma independencia condicional entre as caracteristicas, e assim associa-as a uma entropia da informação (peso nas caracteristicas).

.. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt, or ME) is a general purpose machine learning technique belonging to the class of exponential models using multinomial logistic regression. Unlike NB, ME makes no conditional independence assumption between features, and thereby accounts for information entropy (feature weightings).

Maquinas de Vetores de Suporte (SVM)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As maquinas de vetores de suporte (SVMs) diferem dos modelos de NB e ME em que SVMs não são classificadores probabilisticos que operam por separando pontos dos dados em um espaço utilizando um ou mais hiper-planos (linhas centrais que separam as diferentes classes).

.. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) differ from both NB and ME models in that SVMs are non-probability classifiers which operate by separating data points in space using one or more hyperplanes (centerlines of the gaps separating different classes).

**Exemplo de abordagem utilizado pelo NRC:**

Foi treinado uma Máquina de Vetores de Suporte (SVM) nos dados de treinamento providenciado. Sendo SVM um algoritmo de aprendizagem estado da arte para efetivas tarefas de categorização de textos e robusto em espaços com alta dimensionalidade. O kernel linear com valores de parametro C=0.005 foram escolhidos por validação cruzada nos dados de treinamento. Foram normalizadas todas as URLs para http://someurl e todas as ids de usuarios para @algumusuario. Foram to tokenizados e as partes de discurso marcadas com o Carnegie Mellon University Twitter NLP tool. Cada tweet foram representados como um vetor de aspecto feito pelos seguintes grupos de aspectos:
	* Palavras com ngramas: Presença ou ausência de sequencias continuas de 1, 2, 3, e 4 tokens; ngrama não continuo: ngrama com um token substituido por \*.
	* Caracteres ngramas: presença ou absença de sequencia continua com 3, 4, e 5 caracteres.
	* All-caps: O número de palavras com todos os caracteres maisuculos;
	* POS: O número de ocorrência de cada parte do discurso marcado.
	* Hashtags: O número de hashtags.
	* Léxicons: Os seguintes conjuntos de aspectos foram gerados por cada um dos três léxicos de sentimento construidos manualmente (NRC Emotion Lexicon, MPQA, Bing Liu Lexicon) e para cada um dos 2 lexicos construidos automaticamente  (Hash Sentiment Lexicon e Seniment140 Lexicon). Conjunto de aspectos foram produzidos por unigramas, bigramas, e pares não continualmente. Os aspectos lexicos foram criados por todos os tokens no tweet, por cada parte de discurso marcado, para hashtags e para tokens com letras maiusculas. Para cada token w e emoção o polaridade p,foram usados sentimentos/emoções score(w, p) para determinar:


.. We trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Fan et al., 2008) on the training data provided. SVM is a state-of-the-art learning algorithm  roved to be effective on text categorization tasks and robust on large feature spaces. The linear kernel and the value for the parameter C=0.005 were chosen by crossvalidation on the training data. We normalized all URLs to http://someurl and all userids to @someuser. We tokenized and part-ofspeech tagged the tweets with the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Twitter NLP tool (Gimpel et al., 2011). Each tweet was represented as a feature vector made up of the following groups of features: 
	
.. 	* Word ngrams: presence or absence of contiguous sequences of 1, 2, 3, and 4 tokens; noncontiguous ngrams (ngrams with one token replaced by \*)
.. 	* Character ngrams: presence or absence of contiguous sequences of 3, 4, and 5 characters;
.. 	* All-caps: the number of words with all characters in upper case;
.. 	* POS: the number of occurrences of each partof-speech tag;
.. 	* Hashtags: the number of hashtags;
.. 	* Lexicons: the following sets of features were generated for each of the three manually constructed sentiment lexicons (NRC Emotion Lexicon, MPQA, Bing Liu Lexicon) and for each of the two automatically constructed lexicons (Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon and Sentiment140 Lexicon). Separate feature sets were produced for unigrams, bigrams, and noncontiguous pairs. The lexicon features were created for all tokens in the tweet, for each partof-speech tag, for hashtags, and for all-caps tokens. For each token w and emotion or polarity p, we used the sentiment/emotion score score(w, p) to determine: 
		
		#. Contagem total de tokens nos twtts com score(w, p) > 0
		#. 
		
		#. Total count of tokens in the tweet with score(w, p) > 0;
		#. Total score = P w "pertence" tweet score(w, p)
		#. The maximal score = max w "pertence" tweetscore(w, p);
		#. The score of the last token in the tweet with score(w, p) > 0;

	* Punctuation:

		#. The number of contiguous sequences of exclamation marks, question marks, and both exclamation and question marks;
	 	#. Whether the last token contains an exclamation or question mark;
	 	#. Emoticons: The polarity of an emoticon was determined with a regular expression adopted from Christopher Potts’ tokenizing script:4
	 	#. Pesence or absence of positive and negative emoticons at any position in the tweet;
	 	#. Whether the last token is a positive or negative emoticon; 
	 	#. Elongated words: the number of words with one character repeated more than two times, for example,‘soooo’;
	 	#. Clusters: The CMU pos-tagging tool provides the token clusters produced with the Brown clustering algorithm on 56 million Englishlanguage tweets. These 1,000 clusters serve as alternative representation of tweet content, reducing the sparcity of the token space. 
	 	#. The presence or absence of tokens from each of the 1000 clusters; 
	 	
	 * Negation: the number of negated contexts. Following (Pang et al., 2002), we defined a negated context as a segment of a tweet that starts with a negation word (e.g., no, shouldn’t) and ends with one of the punctuation marks: ‘,’, ‘.’, ‘:’, ‘;’, ‘!’, ‘?’. A negated context affects the ngram and lexicon features: we add ‘ NEG’ suffix to each word following the negation word (‘perfect’ becomes ‘perfect NEG’). The ‘ NEG’ suffix is also added to polarity and emotion features (‘POLARITY positive’ becomes ‘POLARITY positive NEG’). The list of negation words was adopted from Christopher Potts’ sentiment tutorial.

Neural Networks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sentic Neural Networks (SNNs) [53] represent a brain-inspired model based on the combined use of principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) on AffectNet. SNNs investigate if an emulation of the biological neural system, represented by two ANNs, could outperform the previously adopted k-nearest neighbour (KNN) clustering approach. PCA is used to organise the space where concepts lie and then an artificial neural network is trained to recognise emotions based on the presented Hourglass model.

Contrary to any clustering algorithm, the emotion recognition task is independent from both concepts’ absolute and relative positions in the vector space. The eventual aim of the proposed ANN tool developed in this study is to predict which class each concept belongs to (i.e., its level of affective valence in a specific dimension of the Hourglass model).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Methods
*******

To aid these tasks, several researchers have attempted to automatically determine whether a term that is a marker of opinionated content has a Positive or a Negative connotation (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Kamps et al., 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Takamura et al., 2005; Turney and Littman, 2003), since it is by considering the combined contribution of these terms that one may hope to solve Tasks 1, 2 and 3. The conceptually simplest approach to this latter problem is probably Turney’s (Turney, 2002), who has obtained interesting results on Task 2 by considering the algebraic sum of the orientations of terms as representative of the orientation of the document they belong to; but more sophisticated approaches are also possible (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000; Riloff et al., 2003; Whitelaw et al., 2005; Wilson et al., 2004).

Providing a machine with physical knowledge of how objects behave, social knowledge of how people interact, sensory knowledge of how things look and taste and psychological knowledge about the way people think, is not enough to make it intelligent. Having a database of millions of concepts is not very useful for a computer, unless it is able to conveniently use such knowledge base. Our ability to use common-sense knowledge, in fact, highly depends on being able to do common-sense reasoning. Machines need to be taught not just common-sense knowledge itself but also strategies for handling it, retrieving it when necessary, and learning from experience. To this end, adequately broad and deep common-sense knowledge bases are to be developed, as well as reasoning methods that exhibit the features of human thinking, including the ability to reason with knowledge that is true by default, reason rapidly across a broad range of domains, tolerate uncertainty in the available knowledge, take decisions under incomplete knowledge, and perhaps revise that belief or decision when complete knowledge becomes available. It is also important to develop new kinds of cognitive architectures able to support multiple reasoning methods and representations. If a machine is able to represent knowledge and perform reasoning in many different ways, in fact, it can switch among different points of view and find one that works, rather than getting stuck when something goes wrong. This chapter shows how to build a semantic resource of affective common-sense
knowledge and how to exploit it for enabling emotion-sensitive inference (section 3.1). In order to accordingly classify affect in such a knowledge base, moreover, a novel emotion categorisation model (section 3.2) and a new clustering method (section 3.3) are developed. In addition, a technique that combines dimensionality reduction and graph mining methods on two different reasoning levels (section 3.4) is proposed, together with a technique that mimics the human capability to switch between different perspectives (section 3.5) and some concluding remarks (section 3.6).

The pre-processing module firstly exploits linguistic dictionaries to interpret all the
affective valence indicators usually contained in opinionated text, e.g., special punc-
tuation, complete upper-case words, cross-linguistic onomatopoeias, exclamation
words, degree adverbs, and emoticons. Secondly, the module detects negation and
spreads it in a way that it can be accordingly associated to concepts during the pars-
ing phase. Handling negation is an important concern in opinion- and sentiment-
related analysis, as it can reverse the meaning of a statement. Such task, however,
is not trivial as not all appearances of explicit negation terms reverse the polarity
of the enclosing sentence and that negation can often be expressed in rather subtle
ways, e.g., sarcasm and irony, which are quite difficult to detect. Lastly, the module
converts text to lower-case and, after lemmatising it, splits the opinion into single
clauses according to grammatical conjunctions and punctuation.
The sentic parser deconstructs text into concepts using a lexicon based on se-
quences of lexemes that represent multiple-word concepts extracted from AffectNet
and IsaCore. These n-grams are not used blindly as fixed word patterns but ex-
ploited as reference for the module, in order to extract multiple-word concepts from
information-rich sentences. So, differently from other shallow parsers, the module
can recognise complex concepts also when irregular verbs are used or when these
are interspersed with adjective and adverbs, e.g., the concept ‘buy christmas present’
in the sentence “I bought a lot of very nice Christmas presents”.

The sentic parser, additionally, provides, for each retrieved concept, its relative
frequency, valence, and status, i.e., the concept’s occurrence in the text, its positive
or negative connotation, and the degree of intensity with which the concept is ex-
pressed, respectively. For each clause, the module outputs a small bag of concepts
(SBoC), which is later on analysed separately by the IsaCore and AffectiveSpace
modules to infer the cognitive and affective information associated with the input
text, respectively. In case any of the detected concepts is found more than once in the
vector space (that is, any of the concepts has multiple senses), all the SBoC concepts
are exploited for a context-dependent coarse sense disambiguation. In particular, to
represent the expected semantic value of the clause as a whole, the vectors corre-
sponding to all concepts in the clause (in their ambiguous form) can be averaged
together. The resulting vector does not represent a single meaning but the ‘ad hoc
category’ of meanings that are similar to the various possible meanings of concepts
in the clause [133]. Then, to assign the correct sense to the ambiguous concept, the
concept sense with the highest dot product (and thus the strongest similarity) with
the clause vector is searched.
Once natural language text is deconstructed into concepts, these are given as in-
put to both the IsaCore and the AffectiveSpace modules. While the former exploits
the graph representation of the common and common-sense knowledge base to de-
tect semantics, the latter exploits the vector space representation of AffectNet to
infer sentics. In particular, the IsaCore module applies spectral association for as-
signing activation to key nodes of the semantic network, which are used as seeds or
centroids for classification. Such seeds can simply be the concepts corresponding to
the class labels of interest plus their available synonyms and antonyms, if any. As
shown in section 3.5.1, seeds can also be found by applying CF-IOF on a training
corpus (when available), in order to perform a classification that is more relevant to
the data under analysis. After seed concepts are identified, the module spreads their
values across the IsaCore graph. This operation, an approximation of many steps of
spreading activation, transfers the most activation to concepts that are connected to
the seed concepts by short paths or many different paths in affective common-sense
knowledge. Therefore, the concepts of each SBoC provided by the sentic parser are
projected on the matrix resulting from spectral association in order to calculate their
semantic relatedness to each seed concept and, hence, their degree of belonging to
each different class. Such classification measure is directly proportional to the de-
gree of connectivity between the nodes representing the retrieved concepts and the
seed concepts in the IsaCore graph.

Introduction
------------

VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), a simple rule-based model for general sentiment analysis, and compare its effectiveness to eleven typical state-of-practice benchmarks including LIWC, ANEW, the General Inquirer, SentiWordNet, and machine learning oriented techniques relying on Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms.

Proposal
--------

The authors  combine these lexical features with consideration for five general rules that embody grammatical and syntactical conventions for expressing and emphasizing sentiment intensity. 

It seeks to leverage the advantages of parsimonious rule-based modeling to construct a computational sentiment analysis engine that:

	1) Works well on social media style text, yet readily generalizes to multiple domains.
	2) Requires no training data, but is constructed from a generalizable, valence-based, human-curated gold standard sentiment lexicon.
	3) Is fast enough to be used online with streaming data
	4) Does not severely suffer from a speed-performance tradeoff. 

The authors efforts are: 
	1) The development and validation of a gold standard sentiment lexicon that is sensitive both the polarity and the intensity of sentiments expressed in social media microblogs (but which is also generally applicable to sentiment analysis in other domains).
	2) The identification and subsequent experimental evaluation of generalizable rules regarding conventional uses of grammatical and syntactical aspects of text for assessing sentiment intensity.
	3) comparing the performance of a parsimonious lexicon and rule-based model against other established and/or typical sentiment analysis baselines. In each of these three efforts, we incorporate an explicit human-centric approach. 


Constructing and Validating a Valence-Aware Sentiment Lexicon: A Human-Centered Approach
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manually creating (much less, validating) a comprehensive sentiment lexicon is a labor intensive and sometimes error prone process, so it is no wonder that many opinion mining researchers and practitioners rely so heavily on existing lexicons as primary resources. There is, of course, a great deal of overlap in the vocabulary covered by such lexicons; however, there are also numerous items unique to each. We begin by constructing a list inspired by examining existing well-established sentiment word-banks (LIWC,
ANEW, and GI). To this, we next incorporate numerous lexical features common to sentiment expression in microblogs,
including a full list of Western-style emoticons (for example, “:-)” denotes a “smiley face” and generally indicates positive sentiment), sentiment-related acronyms and initialisms11 (e.g., LOL and WTF are both sentimentladen initialisms), and commonly used slang12 with sentiment value (e.g., “nah”, “meh” and “giggly”). This process provided us with over 9,000 lexical feature candidates. 

Next, we assessed the general applicability of each feature candidate to sentiment expressions. We used a wisdom-of-the-crowd13
(WotC) approach (Surowiecki, 2004) to acquire a valid point estimate for the sentiment valence (intensity) of each context-free candidate feature. We collected intensity ratings on each of our candidate lexical features from ten independent human raters (for a total of 90,000+ ratings). Features were rated on a scale from “[–4] Extremely Negative” to “[4] Extremely Positive”, with
allowance for “[0] Neutral (or Neither, N/A)”. Ratings were obtained using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), a micro-labor website where workers perform minor tasks in exchange for a small amount of money (see subsection 3.1.1 for details on how we were able to consistently obtain high quality, generalizable results from AMT workers). Figure 2 illustrates the user interface implemented for acquiring valid point estimates of sentiment intensity for each context-free candidate feature comprising the VADER
sentiment lexicon. (A similar UI was leveraged for all of the evaluation and validation activities described in subsections
3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4.) We kept every lexical feature that had a non-zero mean rating, and whose standard deviation was less than 2.5 as determined by the aggregate of ten independent raters. This left us with just over 7,500 lexical features with validated valence scores that indicated both the sentiment polarity (positive/negative), and the sentiment intensity on a scale from –4 to +4. For example, the word “okay” has a positive valence of 0.9, “good” is 1.9, and “great” is 3.1, whereas “horrible” is –2.5, the frowning emoticon “:(” is –2.2, and “sucks” and “sux” are both –1.5. This gold standard list of features, with associated valence
for each feature, comprises VADER’s sentiment lexicon, and is available for download from our website.



Quality control under AMT Screening, Training, Selecting, and Data Quality Checking Crowd-Sourced Evaluations and Validations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previous linguistic rating experiments using a WotC approach on AMT have shown to be reliable – sometimes even outperforming expert raters (Snow, O’Connor, Jurafsky, & Ng, 2008). On the other hand, prior work has also advised on methods to reduce the amount of noise from AMT workers who may produce poor quality work (Downs, Holbrook, Sheng, & Cranor, 2010; Kittur, Chi, & Suh, 2008). We therefore implemented four quality control processes to help ensure we received meaningful data from our AMT raters. 

	1) Every rater was prescreened for English language reading comprehension – each rater had to individually score an 80% or higher on a standardized college-level reading comprehension test.
	2) Every prescreened rater then had to complete an online sentiment rating training and orientation session, and score 90% or higher for matching the known (prevalidated) mean sentiment rating of lexical items which included individual words, emoticons, acronyms, sentences, tweets, and text snippets (e.g., sentence segments, or phrases). The user interface employed during the sentiment training (Figure 2) always matched the specific sentiment rating tasks discussed in this paper. The training helped to ensure consistency in the rating rubric used by each independent rater.
	3) Every batch of 25 features contained five “golden items” with a known (pre-validated) sentiment rating distribution. If a worker was more than one standard deviation away from the mean of this known distribution on three or more of the five golden items, we discarded all 25 ratings in the batch from this worker.

Finally, we implemented a bonus program to incentivize and reward the highest quality work. For example, we asked workers to select the valence score that they thought “most other people” would choose for the given lexical feature (early/iterative pilot testing revealed that wording the instructions in this manner garnered a much tighter standard deviation without significantly affecting the mean sentiment rating, allowing us to achieve higher quality (generalized) results while being more economical).
We compensated AMT workers $0.25 for each batch of 25 items they rated, with an additional $0.25 incentive bonus for all workers who successfully matched the group mean (within 1.5 standard deviations) on at least 20 of 25 responses in each batch. Using these four quality control methods, we achieved remarkable value in the data obtained from our AMT workers – we paid incentive bonuses for high quality to at least 90% of raters for most batches.

Identifying Generalizable Heuristics Humans Use to Assess Sentiment Intensity in Text
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We next analyze a purposeful sample of 400 positive and 400 negative social media text snippets (tweets). We selected this sample from a larger initial set of 10K random tweets pulled from Twitter’s public timeline based on their sentiment scores using the Pattern.en sentiment analysis engine15 (they were the top 400 most positive and negative tweets in the set). Pattern is a web mining module for Python, and the Pattern.en module is a natural language processing (NLP) toolkit (De Smedt & Daelemans, 2012) that leverages WordNet to score sentiment according to the English adjectives used in the text.

Next, two human experts individually scrutinized all 800 tweets, and independently scored their sentiment intensity on a scale from –4 to +4. Following a data-driven inductive coding technique similar to the Grounded Theory approach (Strauss & Corbin, 1998), we next used qualitative analysis techniques to identify properties and characteristics of the text which affect the perceived sentiment intensity of the text. This deep qualitative analysis resulted in isolating five generalizable heuristics based on grammatical and syntactical cues to convey changes to sentiment intensity. Importantly, these heuristics go beyond what would normally be captured in a typical bag-of-words model. They incorporate word-order sensitive relationships between terms:
	
	1. Punctuation, namely the exclamation point (!), increases the magnitude of the intensity without modifying the semantic orientation. For example, “The food here is good!!!” is more intense than “The food here is good.”
	2. Capitalization, specifically using ALL-CAPS to emphasize a sentiment-relevant word in the presence of other non-capitalized words, increases the magnitude of the sentiment intensity without affecting the semantic orientation. For example, “The food here is GREAT!” conveys more intensity than “The food here is great!”
	3. Degree modifiers (also called intensifiers, booster words, or degree adverbs) impact sentiment intensity by either increasing or decreasing the intensity. For example, “The service here is extremely good” is more intense than “The service here is good”, whereas “The service here is marginally good” reduces the intensity. 
	4. The contrastive conjunction “but” signals a shift in sentiment polarity, with the sentiment of the text following the conjunction being dominant. “The food here is great, but the service is horrible” has mixed sentiment, with the latter half dictating the overall rating. 
	5. By examining the tri-gram preceding a sentiment-laden lexical feature, we catch nearly 90% of cases where negation flips the polarity of the text. A negated sentence would be “The food here isn’t really all that great”.

Controlled Experiments to Evaluate Impact of Grammatical and Syntactical Heuristics
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the general heuristics we just identified, we next selected 30 baseline tweets and manufactured six to ten variations of the exact same text, controlling the specific grammatical or syntactical feature that is presented as an independent variable in a small experiment. With all of the variations, we end up with 200 contrived tweets, which we then randomly insert into a new set of 800 tweets similar to those used during our qualitative analysis. We next asked 30 independent AMT workers to rate the sentiment intensity
of all 1000 tweets to assess the impact of these features on perceived sentiment intensity. (AMT workers were all screened, trained, and data quality checked as described in subsection 3.1.1). Table 2 illustrates some examples of contrived variations on a given baseline:

We incorporated the mean differences between each distribution into VADER’s rule-based model. For example, from Table 3, we see that for 95% of the data, using an exclamation point (relative to a period or no punctuation at all) increased the intensity by 0.261 to 0.322, with a mean difference of 0.291 on a rating scale from 1 to 4 (we use absolute value scale here for simplicity, because it did not matter whether the text was positive or negative, using an exclamation made it equally more extreme in either case).We incorporated consideration for rule 4 by splitting the text into segments around the contrastive conjunction “but”, and diminished the total sentiment intensity of the text preceding the conjunction by 50% while increasing the sentiment intensity of the post-conjunction text by 50%.




Ground Truth in Multiple Domain Contexts
----------------------------------------

We next obtained gold standard (human-validated) ground truth regarding sentiment intensity on corpora representing four distinct domain contexts. For this purpose, we recruited 20 independent human raters from AMT (raters were all screened, trained, and data quality checked consistent with the process described in subsection 3.1.1 and Figure 2). All four sentiment-intensity annotated corpora are available for download from our website14:
	1. Social media text: includes 4,000 tweets pulled from Twitter’s public timeline (with varied times and days of posting), plus 200 contrived tweets that specifically test syntactical and grammatical conventions of conveying differences in sentiment intensity.
	2. Movie reviews: includes 10,605 sentence-level snippets from rotten.tomatoes.com. The snippets were derived from an original set of 2000 movie reviews (1000 positive and 1000 negative) in Pang & Lee (2004); we used the NLTK tokenizer to segment the reviews into sentence phrases, and added sentiment intensity ratings.
	3. Technical product reviews: includes 3,708 sentencelevel snippets from 309 customer reviews on 5 different products. The reviews were originally used in Hu & Liu (2004); we added sentiment intensity ratings.
	4. 4. Opinion news articles: includes 5,190 sentence-level snippets from 500 New York Times opinion editorials.

Results
-------

In order to evaluate our results directly against the broader body of literature, we assess both a) the correlation of computed raw sentiment intensity rating to gold standard ground truth, i.e., the mean sentiment rating from 20 prescreened and appropriately trained human raters, as well as b) the multiclass (positive, negative, neutral) classification metrics of precision, recall, and F1 score. In statistical analysis of classifier performance, precision is the number of true classifications (i.e. the number of items labeled as a particular class that match the known gold standard classification) divided by the total number of elements labeled as
that class (including both correct and incorrect classifications).Recall is the number of true classifications divided by the total number of elements that are known to belong to the class; low recall is an indication that known elementsof a class were missed. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and represents the overall accuracy. We compared the VADER sentiment lexicon to seven other well-established sentiment analysis lexicons: Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC), General Inquirer (GI), Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW), SentiWordNet (SWN), SenticNet (SCN), Word-Sense Disambiguation (WSD) using WordNet, and the Hu-Liu04 opinion lexicon. For fairness to each lexicon, all comparisons utilized VADER’s rule-based model for processing syntactical and grammatical cues – the only difference were the features represented within the actual lexicons themselves. As Figure 3 and Table 4 both show, the VADER lexicon performs exceptionally well in the social media domain, and generalizes favorably. The Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient shows that VADER (r = 0.881) performs as well as individual human raters (r = 0.888) at matching ground truth (aggregated group mean from 20 human raters for sentiment intensity of each tweet). Surprisingly, when we further inspect the classification accuracy (with classification thresholds set at –0.05 and +0.05 for all normalized sentiment scores between -1 and 1), we can see that VADER (F1 = 0.96) actually outperforms even individual human raters (F1 = 0.84) at correctly
classifying the sentiment of tweets. Notice how the LIWC, GI, ANEW, and Hu-liu04 results in Figure 3 show a concentration of tweets incorrectly classified as neutral. Presumably, this is due to lack of coverage for the sentimentoriented language of social media text, which is often expressed using emoticons, slang, or abbreviated text such as acronyms and initialisms. The lexicons for the machine learning algorithms were all constructed by training those models on half the data (again, incorporating all rules), with the other half being held out for testing. While some algorithms performed decently on test data from the specific domain for which it
was expressly trained, they do not significantly outstrip the simple model we use. Indeed, in three out of four cases, VADER performs as well or better across domains than the machine learning approaches do in the same domain for which they were trained. Table 5 explicitly shows this, and also highlights another advantage of VADER – its simplicity makes it computationally efficient, unlike some
SVM models, which were unable to fully process the data from the larger corpora (movie reviews and NYT editorials) even on a multicore system with large RAM:

As discussed in subsections 3.2 and 3.3, we identified and quantified the impact of several generalizable heuristics that humans use when distinguishing between degrees of sentiment intensity. By incorporating these heuristics into VADER’s rule-based model, we drastically improved both the correlation to ground truth as well as the classification accuracy of the sentiment analysis engine. Importantly, these improvements are realized independent of  the lexicon or ML model that was used. That is, when we fairly apply the rules to all lexicons and ML algorithms, we achieve better correlation coefficients (mean r increase of 5.2%) and better accuracies (mean F1 increase of 2.1%). Consistent with prior work (Agarwal, Xie, Vovsha, Rambow, & Passonneau, 2011; Davidov et al., 2010; Shastri, Parvathy, Kumar, Wesley, & Balakrishnan, 2010), we find that grammatical features (conventions of use for punctuation
and capitalization) and consideration for degree modifiers like “very” or “extremely” prove to be useful cues for distinguishing differences in sentiment intensity. Other syntactical considerations identified via qualitative analysis (negation, degree modifiers, and contrastive conjunctions) also help make VADER successful, and is consistent with prior work (Agarwal et al., 2011; Ding, Liu, & Yu, 2008; Lu, Castellanos, Dayal, & Zhai, 2011; Socher et al., 2013).

Discussion
----------

Recent work by Socher et. al (2013) does an excellent job of summarizing (and pushing) the current state of the art for fine-grained sentence-level sentiment analysis by supervised machine learning models. As part of their excellent work using recursive deep models for assessing semantic compositionality over a sentiment tree bank, they report that the state-of-the-art regarding accuracy for simple binary (positive/negative) classification on single sentences is around 80%, and that for the more difficult multiclass
case that includes a third (neutral) class, accuracies tend to hover in the 60% range for social media text (c.f. Agarwal et. al, (2011); Wang et. al (2012)). We find it very encouraging, therefore, to report that the results from VADER’s simple rule-based approach are on par with such sophisticated benchmarks. However, when compared to sophisticated machine learning techniques, the simplicity of VADER carries several advantages. First, it is both quick and computationally economical without sacrificing
accuracy. Running directly from a standard modern laptop computer with typical, moderate specifications (e.g., 3GHz processor and 6GB RAM), a corpus that takes a fraction of a second to analyze with VADER can take hours when using more complex models like SVM (if training is required) or tens of minutes if the model has been previously trained. Second, the lexicon and rules used by VADER are
directly accessible, not hidden within a machine-accessonly black-box. VADER is therefore easily inspected, understood, extended or modified. By exposing both the lexicon and rule-based model, VADER makes the inner workings of the sentiment analysis engine more accessible (and thus, more interpretable) to a broader human audience beyond the computer science community. Sociologists, psychologists, marketing researchers, or linguists who are comfortable using LIWC should also be able to use VADER. Third, by utilizing a general (human-validated) sentiment lexicon and general rules related to grammar and syntax, VADER is at once both self-ontained and domain agnostic – it does not require an extensive set of training data, yet it performs well in diverse domains. We stress that in no way do we intend to convey that complex or sophisticated techniques are in any wrong or bad. Instead we show that a simple, human-centric, interpretable, computationally efficient approach can produce high quality results – even outperforming.individual human raters.


Methodology
-----------



Target domain
-------------

Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we first construct and empirically validate a goldstandard list of lexical features (along with their associated sentiment intensity measures) which are specifically attuned to sentiment in microblog-like contexts. 

The VADER lexicon performs exceptionally well in the social media domain, and generalizes favorably.

Isolate Results
---------------

Interestingly, using our parsimonious rule-based model to assess the sentiment of tweets, we find that VADER outperforms individual human raters (F1 Classification Accuracy = 0.96 and 0.84, respectively), and generalizes more favorably across contexts than any of our benchmarks. 

Interestingly, the VADER lexicon performs exceptionally well in the social media domain. The correlation coefficient shows that VADER (r = 0.881) performs as well as individual human raters (r = 0.888) at matching ground truth (aggregated group mean from 20 human raters for sentiment intensity of each tweet). Surprisingly, when we further inspect the classification accuracy, we see that VADER (F1 = 0.96) actually even outperforms individual human raters (F1 = 0.84) at correctly classifying the sentiment of tweets into positive, neutral, or negative classes.

Isolate Comparations
--------------------
VADER retains (and even improves on) the benefits of traditional sentiment lexicons like LIWC: it is bigger, yet just as simply inspected, understood, quickly applied (without a need for extensive learning/training) and easily extended. Like LIWC (but unlike some other lexicons or machine learning models), the VADER sentiment lexicon is gold-standard quality and has been validated by humans. VADER distinguishes itself from LIWC in that it is more sensitive to sentiment expressions in social media contexts while also generalizing more favorably to other domains.
We make VADER freely available for download and use.

NRC Harshtag and Sentiment140*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We created two state-of-the-art SVM classifiers, one to detect the sentiment of messages and one to detect the sentiment of a term within a message. Our submissions on tweet data stood first in both these subtasks of the SemEval-2013 competition ‘Detecting Sentiment in Twitter’. We implemented a variety of features based on surface form and lexical categories. The sentiment lexicon features (both manually created and automatically generated) along with ngram features (both word and character ngrams) led to the most gain in performance.

NRC Hashtag
------------

Mohammad (2012) showed that hashtagged emotion words such as joy, sadness, angry, and surprised are good indicators that the tweet as a whole (even without the hashtagged emotion word) is expressing the same emotion. We adapted that idea to create a large corpus of positive and negative tweets. We polled the Twitter API every four hours from April to December 2012 in search of tweets with either
a positive word hashtag or a negative word hashtag. A collection of 78 seed words closely related to positive and negative such as #good, #excellent, #bad, and #terrible were used (32 positive and 36 negative). These terms were chosen from entries for positive and negative in the Roget’s Thesaurus. A set of 775,000 tweets were used to generate a large word–sentiment association lexicon. A tweet
was considered positive if it had one of the 32 positive hashtagged seed words, and negative if it had one of the 36 negative hashtagged seed words. The association score for a term w was calculated from these pseudo-labeled tweets as shown below:

score(w) = PMI(w, positive) - PMI(w, negative)(1)

Where PMI stands for pointwise mutual information. A positive score indicates association with positive sentiment, whereas a negative score indicates association with negative sentiment. The magnitude is indicative of the degree of association. The final lexicon, which we will refer to as the NRC Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon has entries for 54,129 unigrams and 316,531 bigrams. Entries were also
generated for unigram–unigram, unigram–bigram, and bigram–bigram pairs that were not necessarily contiguous in the tweets corpus. Pairs with certain punctuations, ‘@’ symbols, and some function words were removed. The lexicon has entries for 308,808 non-contiguous pairs.


NRC Sentiment140*
-----------------

The sentiment140 corpus (Go et al., 2009) is a collection of 1.6 million tweets that contain positive and negative emoticons. The tweets are labeled positive or negative according to the emoticon. We generated a sentiment lexicon from this corpus in the same manner as described above (Section 2.2.1). This lexicon has entries for 62,468 unigrams, 677,698 bigrams, and 480,010 noncontiguous pairs.

Experiments:
------------

We trained the SVM classifier on the set of 9,912 annotated tweets (8,258 in the training set and 1,654 in the development set). We applied the model to the test set of 3,813 unseen tweets. The same model was applied unchanged to the other test set of 2,094 SMS messages as well. The bottom-line score used by the task organizers was the macro-averaged F-score of the positive and negative classes. The results obtained
by our system on the training set (ten-fold cross-validation), development set (when trained on the training set), and test sets (when trained on the combined set of tweets in the training and development sets) are shown in Table 2. The table also shows baseline results obtained by a majority classifier that always predicts the most frequent class as output. Since the bottom-line F-score is based only on the F-scores of positive and negative classes (and not on neutral), the majority baseline chose the most frequent class among positive and negative, which in this case was the positive class. We also show baseline results obtained using an SVM and unigram features alone. Our system (SVM and all features) obtained a macro-averaged F-score of 69.02 on the tweet set and 68.46 on the SMS set. In the SemEval- 2013 competition, our submission ranked first on both datasets. There were 48 submissions from 34 teams for this task. Table 3 shows the results of the ablation experiments where we repeat the same classification process but remove one feature group at a time. The most influential features for both datasets turned out to be the sentiment lexicon features: they provided gains of more than 8.5%. It is interesting to note that tweets benefited mostly from the automatic sentiment lexicons (NRC Hashtag Lexicon and the Sentiment140 Lexicon) whereas the SMS set benefited
more from the manual lexicons (MPQA, NRC Emotion Lexicon, Bing Liu Lexicon). Among the automatic lexicons, both the Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon
and the Sentiment140 Lexicon contributed to roughly the same amount of improvement in performance on the tweet set.

The second most important feature group for the message-level task was that of ngrams (word and character ngrams). Expectedly, the impact of ngrams on the SMS dataset was less extensive since the classifier model was trained only on tweets. Attention to negations improved performance on both datasets. Removing the sentiment encoding features like hashtags, emoticons, and elongated words, had almost no impact on performance, but this is probably because the discriminating information in them was also captured by some other features such as character and word ngrams.

Comparative between Methods
***************************

However, as Hutto, Yardi, & Gilbert (2013) point out, despite its widespread use for assessing sentiment in social media text, LIWC does not include consideration for sentiment-bearing lexical items such as acronyms, initialisms, emoticons, or slang, which are known to be important for sentiment analysis of social text (Davidov, Tsur, & Rappoport, 2010). 

Also, LIWC is unable to account for differences in the sentiment intensity of words. For example, “The food here is exceptional” conveys more positive intensity than “The food here is okay”. A sentiment analysis tool using LIWC would score them equally (they each contain one positive term). Such distinctions are intuitively valuable for fine-grained sentiment analysis.

Combination between Methods
***************************

Sentiment Analisys Beyond English
*********************************
Several approaches have been developed for the general task of mapping a given piece of text to a label belonging to a predefined set of categories, or to a real number representative of a polarity degree. Such approaches and their performance, however, are strictly bound to the considered domain of application and to the related topics. Moreover, most of the literature on sentiment analysis has focused on text written in English and consequently most of the resources developed, such as lexicons with sentiment labels, are in English. Adapting such resources to other languages can be considered as a domain adaptation problem [310, 46]. This section discusses the evolution of different approaches and depths of analysis [58], i.e., from heuristics to discourse structure (section 2.2.1), from coarse to fine grained analysis (section 2.2.2), from keyword to concept level opinion mining (section 2.2.3). 

Despite the language barrier, in fact, moving to a new place involves facing habits and situations that might go against what we consider basic rules of social interaction or things we were taught by our parents, such as eating with hands, eating from someone else’s plate, slurping on noodle-like food or while drinking tea, eating on the street, crossing the road despite the heavy traffic, squatting when tired, removing shoes at home, growing long nails on your last fingers, or bargaining on anything you need to buy. This can happen also the other way around, that is, when you do something perfectly in line with your common-sense that violates the local norms, e.g., cheek kissing as a form of greeting.

The relationship between emotion and language (and the fact that the language of emotion is considered a vital part of the experience of emotion) has been used by social constructivists and anthropologists to question the universality of Ekman’s studies, arguably because the language labels he used to code emotions are somewhat US-centric. In addition, other cultures might have labels that cannot be literally translated to English (e.g., some languages do not have a word for fear [247]).

Human emotions to Computer Emotion
**********************************
Emotions are different Ways to Think [199] that our mind triggers to deal with dif-
ferent situations we face in our lives. Our ability to reason and make decisions, in
fact, is strictly dependent on both our common-sense knowledge about the world
and our inner emotional states. This capability, termed affective common sense
reasoning, is a fundamental component in human experience, cognition, percep-
tion, learning, and communication. For this reason, we cannot prescind from emo-
tions in the development of intelligent user interfaces: if we want computers to be
really intelligent, not just have the veneer of intelligence, we need to give them
the ability to recognise, understand, and express emotions. There is extensive ev-
idence for the existence of multiple processing systems within the human brain
[156, 67, 259, 102, 177]. In order not to get stuck and to be able to tackle differ-
ent problems from different perspectives, in fact, an intelligent machine should not
have a unique way to deal with a task, but rather be endowed with different reason-
ing strategies and with the capability to switch among these.
This section discusses an approach to emulate the human capability to switch
between different perspectives and find novel ways to look at things. Such approach
is inspired by Minsky’s notion of ‘panalogy’ (parallel analogy), which states that
several analogous representations of the same problem should be maintained in par-
allel while trying to solve it so that, as soon as problem solving begins to fail when
using one representation, the system can switch to one of the others [199]. In par-
ticular, multi-dimensionality reduction techniques are employed on AffectNet to
dynamically configure it and, hence, model the switch between different reasoning
strategies (section 3.5.1), while graph mining and clustering methods are applied
to model the switch between the foci around which those strategies are developed
[56], in order to accordingly exploit the different facets of the affective common-
sense knowledge base (section 3.5.2).

Categorical Versus Dimensional Approaches
*****************************************

Philosophical studies on emotions date back to ancient Greeks and Romans. Fol-
lowing the early Stoics, for example, Cicero enumerated and organised the emotions
into four basic categories: metus (fear), aegritudo (pain), libido (lust), and laetitia
(pleasure). Studies on evolutionary theory of emotions, in turn, were initiated in the
late 19th century by Darwin [71]. His thesis was that emotions evolved via natural
selection and, therefore, have cross-culturally universal counterparts. In the early
1970s, Ekman found evidence that humans share six basic emotions: happiness,
sadness, fear, anger, disgust, and surprise [99]. Few tentative efforts to detect non-
basic affective states, such as fatigue, anxiety, satisfaction, confusion, or frustration,
have been also made [250, 225, 234, 96, 149, 64] (Table 3.4).
In 1980, Averill put forward the idea that emotions cannot be explained strictly
on the basis of physiological or cognitive terms. Instead, he claimed that emotions
are primarily social constructs; hence, a social level of analysis is necessary to truly
understand the nature of emotion [14]. The relationship between emotion and lan-
guage (and the fact that the language of emotion is considered a vital part of the
experience of emotion) has been used by social constructivists and anthropologists
to question the universality of Ekman’s studies, arguably because the language la-
bels he used to code emotions are somewhat US-centric. In addition, other cultures
might have labels that cannot be literally translated to English (e.g., some languages
do not have a word for fear [247]).
For their deep connection with language and for the limitedness of the emo-
tional labels used, all such categorical approaches usually fail to describe the com-
plex range of emotions that can occur in daily communication. The dimensional
approach [214], in turn, represents emotions as coordinates in a multi-dimensional
space. For both theoretical and practical reasons, more and more researchers like
to define emotions according to two or more dimensions. An early example is Rus-
sell’s circumplex model [246], which uses the dimensions of arousal and valence to
plot 150 affective labels (Fig. 3.5).

Besides bi-dimensional approaches, a commonly used set for emotion dimen-
sion is the <arousal, valence, dominance> set, which is known in the literature
also by different names, including <evaluation, activation, power> and <pleasure,
arousal, dominance> [193]. Recent evidence suggests there should be a fourth di-
mension: Fontaine et al. reported consistent results from various cultures where a
set of four dimensions is found in user studies, namely <valence, potency, arousal,
unpredictability> [111]. Dimensional representations of affect are attractive mainly
because they provide a way of describing emotional states that is more tractable than
using words. This is of particular importance when dealing with naturalistic data,
where a wide range of emotional states occurs. Similarly, they are much more able
to deal with non-discrete emotions and variations in emotional states over time [76],
since in such cases changing from one universal emotion label to another would not
make much sense in real life scenarios.

Dimensional approaches, however, have a few limitations. Although the dimen-
sional space allows to compare affect words according to their reciprocal distance,
it usually does not allow making operations between these, e.g., for studying com-
pound emotions. Most dimensional representations, moreover, do not model the fact
that two or more emotions may be experienced at the same time. Eventually, all such
approaches work at word level, which makes them unable to grasp the affective va-
lence of multiple-word concepts.

Real Application with Sentiment Analyses
****************************************

Sentiment analysis has been traditionally more focused on the extraction of the valence of textual sample (i.e., positive/negative or bad/good) rather than assigning a particular emotion category to text. However, the classification of multimedia resources according to their mood and emotional content is also quite common. The advent of Web 2.0 has pushed the users at the centre of the Web universe, providing them revolutionary tools that have changed the way people communicate and express themselves, their ideas, and emotions. People spend more and more time using the Web not only for work, but also for expressing their opinions on blogs and forums, chatting, and organising events through social networks, and even for living a Second Life 7 . Therefore, the Web contains more and more affective content. The awareness that the capability to manage such affective content can be exploited for the development of next-generation web applications is dragging a growing attention also in sentiment analysis for affect extraction from textual Web content.

For example, LIWC’s lexicon has been used to extract indications of political sentiment from tweets (Tumasjan, Sprenger, Sandner, & Welpe, 2010), predict the onset of depression in individuals based on text from social media (De Choudhury, Gamon, Counts, & Horvitz, 2013), characterize the emotional variability of pregnant mothers from Twitter posts (De Choudhury, Counts, & Horvitz, 2013), unobtrusively measure national happiness based on Facebook status updates (Kramer, 2010), and differentiating happy romantic couples from unhappy ones based on their instant message communications (Hancock, Landrigan, & Silver, 2007). 

Today, opinion mining and sentiment analysis find applications in several different scenarios and there is a good number of companies, large and small, that include the analysis of opinions and sentiments as part of their mission. In current product review websites, such as Epinions 1 , Yelp 2 , and RateItAll 3 , feedback and reviews are explicitly solicited within the web interface. Opinion mining techniques can be exploited for the creation and automated upkeep of review and opinion aggregation websites, in which opinions are continuously gathered from the Web and not restricted to just product reviews, but also to wider topics such as political issues and brand perception. Opinion mining and sentiment analysis have also a great potential as sub-component technology for other system. They can enhance the capabilities of customer relationship management (CRM) and recommendation systems allowing, for example, to find out which features customers are particularly interested in or to exclude from the recommendations items that have received very negative feedbacks [277, 278].

In order to assess the capability of the opinion mining engine (or parts of it) to tackle real-world NLP tasks, the process for the extraction of semantics and sentics has been embedded in multiple systems for the development of intelligent applications in different domains. Specifically, sentic computing tools and techniques have been exploited for the design of Social Web applications, i.e., a troll filtering system, a social media marketing tool, and an online personal photo management system (section 5.1); HCI applications, that is, an embodied conversational agent with affective common-sense, an adaptive IM tool, and an emotion-sensitive IUI (section 5.2); and e-health applications, i.e., a framework for assessing the quality of health-care providers and a tool for enhancing PROMs for HRQoL (section 5.3). All these developed applications demonstrate how the opinion mining engine can
be employed in nearly any domain, as it does not rely on domain-dependent keywords, but rather on common-sense knowledge bases that allow it to extrapolate the cognitive and affective information associated with natural language text. The tools and techniques employed for the development of such engine are summarised in the following chapter, where a discussion about limitations and future developments of these is also offered.

.. Troll Filtering
.. ---------------

.. The democracy of the Web is what made it so popular in the past decades, but such a high degree of freedom of expression also gave birth to negative side effects the so called ‘dark side’ of the Web. Be it real or virtual world, in fact, existence of malicious faction among inhabitants and users is inevitable. An example of this, in the Social Web context, is the exploitation of anonymity to post inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community, with the primary intent of provoking other users into a desired emotional response or of otherwise disrupting normal on-topic discussion. Such a practice is usually referred as as 'trolling' and the generator of such messages is called ‘a troll’. The term was first used in early 1990 and since then a lot of concern has been raised to contain or curb trolls. The trend of trolling appears to have spread a lot recently and it is alarming most of the biggest social networking sites since, in extreme cases such as abuse, has led some teenagers to commit suicide. These attacks usually address not only individuals, but also entire communities. For example, reports have claimed that a growing number of Facebook tribute pages had been targeted, including those in memory of the Cumbria shootings victims and soldiers who died in Afghanistan. At present, users cannot do much rather than manually delete abusive messages. Current anti-trolling methods, in fact, mainly consist in identifying additional accounts that use the same IP address and blocking fake accounts based on name and anomalous site activity, e.g., users who send lots of messages to non-friends or whose friend requests are rejected at a high rate. In July 2010, Facebook launched an application that gives users a direct link to advice, help, and the ability to report cyber problems to the child exploitation and online protection centre (CEOP). Reporting trouble through a link or a button, however, is a too slow process since social networking websites usually cannot react instantly to these alarms. A button, moreover, does not stop users from being emotionally hurt by trolls and it is more likely to be pushed by people who actually do not need help rather than, for instance, children who are being sexually groomed and do not realise it. 
.. A prior analysis of the trustworthiness of statements published on the Web has been presented by Rowe and Butters [245]. Their approach adopts a contextual trust value determined for the person who asserted a statement as the trustworthiness of the statement itself. Their study, however, does not focus on the problem of trolling, but rather on defining a contextual accountability for the detection of web, email, and opinion spam. The main aim of the troll filter [38] (Fig. 5.1) is to identify malicious contents in natural language text with a certain confidence level and, hence, automatically block trolls. To train the system, the concepts most commonly used by trolls are first identified by using the CF-IOF technique and, then, this set is
.. expanded through spectral association. In particular, after analysing a set of 1000 offensive phrases extracted from Wordnik 1 , it was found that, statistically, a post is likely to be edited by a troll when its average sentic vector has a high absolute value of Sensitivity and a very low polarity. Hence, the trollness t i associated to a concept c i is defined as a float 2 [0, 1] such that: 
.. where s i (float 2 [0, 1]) is the semantic similarity of c i wrt any of the CF-IOF seed
.. concepts, p i (float 2 [ 1, 1]) is the polarity associated to the concept c i , and 3 is the
.. normalisation factor. Hence, the total trollness of a post containing N concepts is
.. defined as:
.. FORMULA OLHAR NO ARTIGO
.. This information is stored, together with post type and content plus sender and
.. receiver ID, in an interaction database that keeps trace of all the messages and com-
.. ments interchanged between users within the same social network. Posts with a high
.. level of trollness (current threshold has been set, using a trial-and-error approach, to
.. 60%) are labelled as troll posts and, whenever a specific user addresses more than
.. two troll posts to the same person or community, his/her sender ID is labelled as troll
.. for that particular receiver ID. All the past troll posts sent to that particular receiver
.. ID by that specific sender ID are then automatically deleted from the website (but
.. kept in the database with the possibility for the receiver to either visualise them in
.. an apposite troll folder and, in case, restore them). Moreover, any new post with a
.. high level of trollness edited by a user labelled as troll for that specific receiver is
.. automatically blocked, i.e., saved in the interaction database but never displayed in
.. the social networking website.
.. This information, encoded as a sentic vector, is given as input to a troll detector
.. which exploits it, together with the semantic information coming directly from the
.. sentic parser, to calculate the post’s trollness and, eventually, to detect and block the
.. troll (according to the information stored in the interaction database). As an example
.. of troll filtering process output, a troll post recently addressed to the Indian author,
.. Chetan Bhagat, can be considered: “You can’t write, you illiterate douchebag, so
.. quit trying, I say!!!”. In this case, there are a very high level of Sensitivity (corre-
.. sponding sentic level ‘rage’) and a negative polarity,

Social Media Marketing

The advent of Web 2.0 made users more enthusiastic about interacting, sharing, and
collaborating through social networks, online communities, blogs, wikis, and other
online collaborative media. In the last years, this collective intelligence has spread
to many different areas in the Web, with particular focus on fields related to our
everyday life such as commerce, tourism, education, and health. The online review
of commercial services and products, in particular, is an action that users usually
perform with pleasure, to share their opinions about services they have received
or products they have just bought, and it constitutes immeasurable value for other
potential buyers.
This trend opened new doors to enterprises that want to reinforce their brand and
product presence in the market by investing in online advertising and positioning.
In confirmation of the growing interest in social media marketing, several commer-
cial tools have been recently developed to provide companies with a way to analyse
the blogosphere on a large scale in order to extract information about the trend of
the opinions relative to their products. Nevertheless most of the existing tools and
the research efforts are limited to a polarity evaluation or a mood classification ac-
cording to a very limited set of emotions. In addition, such methods mainly rely on
parts of text in which emotional states are explicitly expressed and, hence, they are
unable to capture opinions and sentiments that are expressed implicitly. To this end,
a novel social media marketing tool has been proposed [39] to provide marketers
with an IUI for the management of social media information at semantic level, able
to capture both opinion polarity and affective information associated with UGCs. A
polarity value associated to an opinion, in fact, sometimes can be restrictive. Enrich-
ing automatic analysis of social media with affective labels such as ‘joy’ or ‘disgust’
can help marketers to have a clearer idea of what their customers think about their
products. In particular, YouTube was selected as a social media source since, with
its over 2 billions views per day, 24 hours of video uploaded every minute, and 15
minutes a day spent by the average user, it represents more than 40% of online video
market 2 . Specifically, the focus was on video reviews of mobile phones because of
the quantity and the quality of the comments usually associated with them.
The social media analysis is performed through three main steps: firstly, com-
ments are analysed using the opinion mining engine; secondly, the extracted in-
formation is encoded on the base of different web ontologies; finally, the resulting
knowledge base is made available for browsing through a multi-faceted classifica-
tion website. Social Web resources represent a peculiar kind of data that is charac-
terised for a deeply interconnected nature. The Web itself is, in fact, based on links
that bound together different data and information, and community-contributed mul-
timedia resources characterise themselves for the collaborative way in which they
are created and maintained. An effective description of such resources needs there-
fore to capture and manage such interconnected nature, allowing to encode infor-
mation not only about the resource itself, but also about the linked resources into an
interconnected knowledge base. Encoding information relative to a market product
to analyse its market trends represents a situation in which this approach is particu-
larly suitable and useful. In this case, in fact, it is necessary not only to encode the
information relative to product features, but also the information about the producer,
the consumers, and their opinions.
The proposed framework for opinion description and management aims to be
applicable to most of online resources (videos, images, text) coming from different
sources, e.g., online video sharing services, blogs, and social networks. To such
purpose, it is necessary to standardise as much as possible the descriptors used
in encoding the information about multimedia resources and people to which the
opinions refer (considering that every website uses its own vocabulary), in order
to make it univocally interpretable and suitable to feed other applications. For this
reason, the information relative to multimedia resources and people is encoded us-
ing the descriptors provided by OMR 3 (Ontology for Media Resources) and FOAF 4
(Friend of a Friend Ontology), respectively. OMR represents an important effort to
help circumventing the current proliferation of audio/video metadata formats, cur-
rently carried on by the W3C Media Annotations Working Group. It offers a core
vocabulary to describe media resources on the Web, introducing descriptors such
as ‘title’, ‘creator’, ‘publisher’, ‘createDate’, and ‘rating’, and it defines semantic-
preserving mappings between elements from existing formats in order to foster the
interoperability among them.
FOAF represents a recognised standard in describing people, providing informa-
tion such as their names, birthdays, pictures, blogs, and especially other people they
know, which makes it particularly suitable for representing data that appear in social
networks and communities. OMR and FOAF together supply most of the vocabu-
lary needed for describing media and people; other descriptors are added only when
necessary. For example, OMR does not currently supply vocabulary for describing
comments, which are hereby analysed to extract the affective information relative to
media. Hence, the ontology is extended by introducing the ‘Comment’ class and by
defining for it the ‘author’, ‘text’, and ‘publicationDate’ properties.
In HEO, properties to link emotions to multimedia resources and people were in-
troduced. In particular, ‘hasManifestationInMedia’ and ‘isGeneratedByMedia’ were
defined to describe emotions that occur and are generated in media, respectively,
while the property ‘affectPerson’ was defined to connect emotions to people. Ad-
ditionally, WNA was exploited as an ontology in order to improve the hierarchical
organisation of emotions in HEO. Thus, the combination of HEO with WNA, OMR,
and FOAF provides a complete framework to describe not only multimedia contents
and the users that have created, uploaded, or interacted with them, but also the opin-
ions and the affective content carried by the media and the way they are perceived
by web users (Fig. 5.2).
As remarked above, due to the way they are created and maintained, community-
contributed multimedia resources are very different from standard web data. One
fundamental aspect is the collaborative way in which such data is created, uploaded,
and annotated. A deep interconnection emerges in the nature of these data and meta-
data, allowing for example to associate videos of completely different genre, but
uploaded by the same user, or different users, even living in opposite sides of the
world, who have appreciated the same pictures. In the context of social media mar-
keting, this interdependence can be exploited to find similar patterns in customer
reviews of commercial products and, hence, to gather useful information for mar-
keting, sales, public relations, and customer service. Online reviews of electronics
products, in particular, usually offer substantial and reliable information about the
perceived quality of the products because of the size of electronics online market
and the type of customers related to it.
To visualise this information, the multi-faceted categorisation paradigm is ex-
ploited. Faceted classification allows the assignment of multiple categories to an
object, enabling the classifications to be ordered in multiple ways, rather than in
a single, pre-determined, and taxonomic order. This makes possible to perform
searches combining the textual approach with the navigational one. Faceted search,
in fact, enables users to navigate a multi-dimensional information space by con-
currently writing queries in a text box and progressively narrowing choices in each
dimension. For this application, specifically, the SIMILE Exhibit API 5 is used. Ex-
hibit consists of a set of Javascript files that allow to easily create rich interactive
web pages including maps, timelines, and galleries, with very detailed client-side
filtering. Exhibit pages use the multi-faceted classification paradigm to display se-
mantically structured data stored in a Semantic Web aware format, e.g., RDF or
JavaScript object notation (JSON). One of the most relevant aspects of Exhibit is
that, once the page is loaded, the web browser also loads the entire data set in a
lightweight database and performs all the computations (sorting, filtering, etc.) lo-
cally on the client-side, providing high performance.
Because they are one of the most prolific types of electronic products in terms
of data reviews available on the Web, mobile phones were selected as a review tar-
get. In particular, a set of 220 models was considered. Such models were ranked
as the most popular according to Kelkoo 6 , a shopping site featuring online shop-
ping guides and user reviews, from which all the available information about each
handset, such as model, brand, input type, screen resolution, camera type, standby
time, and weight, was parsed. This information was encoded in RDF and stored in a
Sesame 7 triple-store, a purpose-built database for the storage and retrieval of RDF
metadata. YouTube Data API was then exploited to retrieve from YouTube database
the most relevant video reviews for each mobile phone and their relative metadata
such as duration, rating, upload date and name, gender, and country of the uploaders.
The comments associated with each video were also extracted and processed
by means of sentic computing for emotion recognition and polarity detection. The
extracted opinions in RDF/XML were then encoded using the descriptors defined
by HEO, WNA, OMR, and FOAF, and inserted into the triple-store. Sesame can
be embedded in applications and used to conduct a wide range of inferences on
the information stored, based on RDFS and OWL type relations between data. In
addition, it can also be used in a standalone server mode, much like a traditional
database with multiple applications connecting to it. In this way, the knowledge
stored inside Sesame can be easily queried; optionally, results can also be retrieved
in a semantic aware format and used for other applications. For the developed demo,
the information contained in the triple-store was exported into a JSON file, in order
to make it available for being browsed as a unique knowledge base through Exhibit
interface.
In the IUI, mobile phones are displayed through a dynamic gallery that can be or-
dered according to different parameters, e.g., model, price, and rating, showing tech-
nical information jointly with their video reviews and the opinions extracted from
the relative comments (Fig. 5.3). By using faceted menus, moreover, it is possible
to explore such information both using the search box (to perform keyword-based
queries) and filtering the results using the faceted menus (by adding or removing
constraints on the facet properties). In this way, it becomes very easy and intuitive
to search for mobile phones of interest: users can specify the technical features
required using the faceted menus and compare different phones that match such
requirements by consulting the video reviews and the opinions extracted from the
relative comments.
In addition, it is possible to explore in detail the comments of each video review
through a specific Exhibit page in which comments are organised in a timeline and
highlighted in different colours, according to the value of their polarity. Moreover,
faceted menus allow filtering the comments according to the reviewers’ information,
e.g., age, gender, and nationality. Using such a tool a marketer can easily get an
insight about the trend of a product, e.g., at the end of an advertising campaign, by
observing how the number of reviews and the relative satisfaction evolve in time
and by monitoring this trend for different campaign targets.
In order to evaluate the proposed system both on the level of opinion mining and
sentiment analysis, we separately tested its polarity detection accuracy with a set
of like/dislike-rated video reviews from YouTube and evaluated its affect recogni-
tion capabilities with a corpus of mood-tagged blogs from LiveJournal. In order to
evaluate the system in terms of polarity detection accuracy, we exploited YouTube
Data API to retrieve from YouTube database the ratings relative to the 220 video
reviews previously selected for displaying in the faceted classification interface. On
YouTube, in fact, users can express their opinions about videos either by adding
comments or by simply rating them using a like/dislike button. YouTube Data API
makes this kind of information available by providing, for each video, number of
raters and average rating, i.e., sum of likes and dislikes divided by number of raters.
This information is expressed as a float 2 [1, 5] and indicates if a video is generally
considered as bad (float 2 [1, 3]) or good (float 2 [3, 5]).
This information was compared with the polarity values previously extracted by
employing sentic computing on the comments relative to each of the 220 videos.
True positives were identified as videos with both an average rating 2 [3, 5] and a
polarity 2 [0, 1] (for positively rated videos), or videos with both an average rat-
ing 2 [1, 3] and a polarity 2 [-1, 0] (for negatively rated videos). The evaluation
showed that, by using the system to perform polarity detection, negatively and pos-
itively rated videos (37.7% and 62.3% of the total respectively) can be identified
with precision of 97.1% and recall of 86.3% (91.3% F-measure).
Since no mood-labelled dataset about commercial products is currently avail-
able, the LiveJournal database was used to test the system’s affect recognition ca-
pabilities. For this test, a reduced set of 10 moods has been considered, specifi-
cally, ‘ecstatic’, ‘happy’, ‘pensive’, ‘surprised’, ‘enraged’, ‘sad’, ‘angry’, ‘annoyed’,
‘scared’, and ‘bored’. All LiveJournal accounts have Atom, RSS, and other data
feeds that show recent public entries, friend relationships, and interests. Unfortu-
nately, it is not possible to get mood-tagged blogposts via data feeds, hence, an ad
hoc crawler had to be designed. After retrieving and storing relevant data and meta-
data for a total of 5,000 posts, the sentics extraction process was conducted on each
of these and outputs were compared with the relative LiveJournal mood tags, in
order to compute recall and precision rates as evaluation metrics (Fig. 5.4).
On average, each post contained around 140 words and, from it, about 4 affective
valence indicators and 60 sentic vectors were extracted. According to this informa-
tion, mood-labels were assigned to each post and compared with the corresponding
LiveJournal mood tags, obtaining very good accuracy for each of the 10 selected
moods (Table 5.2). Among these, ‘happy’ and ‘sad’ posts were identified with par-
ticularly high precision (89.2% and 81.8%, respectively) and decorous recall rates
(76.5% and 68.4%). The F-measure values obtained, hence, were significantly good
(82.3% and 74.5%, respectively), especially if compared to the corresponding F-
measure rates of a standard keyword spotting system based on a set of 500 affect
words (65.7% and 58.6%).

Sentic Album


Efficient access to online personal pictures requires the ability to properly annotate,
organise, and retrieve the information associated with them. While the technology
to search personal documents has been available for some time, the technology to
manage personal images is much more challenging. This is mainly due to the fact
that, even if images can be roughly interpreted automatically, many salient features
exist only in the user’s mind. The only way for a system to accordingly index per-
sonal images, hence, is to try to capture and process such features.
Existing content based image retrieval (CBIR) systems such as QBIC [110], Vi-
rage [15], MARS [233], ImageGrouper [206], MediAssist [210], CIVR [253], EGO
[288], ACQUINE [89], and K-DIME [23] have attempted to build IUIs capable
of retrieving pictures according to their intrinsic content through statistics, pattern
recognition, signal processing, computer vision, support vector machines, and neu-
ral networks, but all such techniques appeared too weak to bridge the gap between
the data representation and the images’ conceptual models in the user’s mind. Im-
age meta search engines such as Webseek [260], Webseer [112], PicASHOW [169],
IGroup [145], or Google 8 , Yahoo 9 , and Bing 10 Images, on the other hand, rely on
tags associated with online pictures but, in the case of personal photo management,
users are unlikely to expend substantial effort to manually classify and categorise
images in the hopes of facilitating future retrieval. Moreover these techniques, as
they depend on keyword-based algorithms, often miss potential connections be-
tween words expressed through different vocabularies or concepts that exhibit im-
plicit semantic connectedness. In order to properly deal with photo metadata and,
hence, effectively annotate images, in fact, it is necessary to work at a semantic,
rather than syntactic, level.
A good effort in this sense has been made within the development of ARIA [175],
a software agent which aims to facilitate the storytelling task by opportunistically
suggesting photos that may be relevant to what the user is typing. ARIA goes be-
yond the na naıve approach of suggesting photos by simply matching keywords in a
photo annotation with keywords in the story, as it also takes into account seman-
tically related concepts. A similar approach has been followed by Raconteur [72],
a system for conversational storytelling that encourages people to make coherent
points, by instantiating large-scale story patterns and suggesting illustrative media.
It exploits a large common-sense knowledge base to perform NLP in real-time on
a text chat between a storyteller and a viewer and recommends appropriate media
items from a library. Both these approaches present a lot of advantages since con-
cepts, unlike keywords, are not sensitive to morphological variation, abbreviations,
or near synonyms. However, simply relying on a semantic knowledge base is not
enough to infer the salient features that make different pictures more or less relevant
in each user’s mind.
To this end, Sentic Album [43] exploits AI and Semantic Web techniques to per-
form reasoning on different knowledge bases and, hence, infer both the cognitive
and affective information associated with photo metadata. The system, moreover,
supports this concept-level analysis with content and context based techniques, in
order to capture all the different aspects of online pictures and, hence, provide users
with an IUI that is navigable in real-time through a multi-faceted classification web-
site. Much of what is called problem-solving intelligence, in fact, is really the ability
to identify what is relevant and important in a context and to subsequently make that
knowledge available just in time [176].
Cognitive and affective processes are tightly intertwined in everyday life [84].
The affective aspect of cognition and communication is recognised to be a crucial
part of human intelligence and has been argued to be more fundamental in human
behaviour for ensuring success in social life than intellect [292, 221]. Emotions,
in fact, influence our ability to perform common cognitive tasks, such as forming
memories and communicating with other people. A psychological study, for exam-
ple, showed that people asked to conceal emotional facial expressions in response to
unpleasant and pleasant slides remembered the slides less well than control partici-
pants [28]. Similarly, a study of conversations revealed that romantic partners who
were instructed to conceal both facial and vocal cues of emotion while talking about
important relationship conflicts with each other, remembered less of what was said
than did partners who received no suppression instructions [241]. Many studies have
indicated that emotions both seem to improve memory for the gist of an event and
to undermine memory for more peripheral aspects of the event [32, 75, 298, 239].
The idea, broadly, is that arousal causes a decrease in the range of cues an or-
ganism can take in. This narrowing of attention leads directly to the exclusion of
peripheral cues, and this is why emotionality undermines memory for information
at the event’s edge. At the same time, this narrowing allows a concentration of men-
tal resources on more central materials, and this leads to the beneficial effects of
emotion on memory for the event’s centre [163]. Hence, rather than assigning par-
ticular cognitive and affective valence to a specific visual stimulus, we more often
balance the importance of personal pictures is according to how much information
contained in them is pertinent to our lives, goals, and values (or perhaps, the lives
and values of people we care about). For this reason, a bad quality picture can be
ranked high in the mind of a particular user, if it reminds him/her of a notably im-
portant moment or person of his/her life.
Events, in fact, are likely to be organised in the human mind as interconnected
concepts and most of the links relating such concepts are probably weighted by af-
fect, as we tend to better recall memories associated with either very positive or very
negative emotions, as well as we usually tend to more easily forget about concepts
associated with very little or null affective valence. The problem, when trying to
emulate such cognitive and affective processes, is that, while cognitive information
is usually objective and unbiased, affective information is rather subjective and ar-
gumentative. For example, while in the cognitive domain ‘car’ is always a car and
there is usually not much discussion about the correctness of retrieving an image
showing a tree in an African savannah under the label ‘landscape’, there might be
some discussion about whether the retrieved car is “cool” or just “nice”, or whether
the found landscape is “peaceful” or “dull” [127]. To this end, Sentic Album ap-
plies sentic computing techniques on pictures data and metadata to infer what really
matters to each user in different online photos. In particular, the Annotation Module
mainly exploits metadata such as descriptions, tags, and comments, termed ‘con-
ceptual metadata’, associated with each image to extract its relative semantics and
sentics and, hence, enhance the picture specification with its intrinsic cognitive and
affective information. This concept-level annotation procedure is performed through
the opinion mining engine and it is supported with a parallel content and context
level analysis.
The content based annotation, in particular, is performed through Python Imag-
ing Library 11 (PIL), an external library for the Python 12 programming language that
adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file for-
mats. For every online personal picture, in particular, PIL is exploited to extract
luminance and chrominance information and other image statistics, e.g., the total,
mean, standard deviation, and variance of the pixel values.
The context-based annotation, in turn, exploits information such as timestamp,
geolocation, and user interaction metadata. Such metadata, termed ‘contextual meta-
data’, are processed by the Context Deviser, a sub-module that extracts small bits
of information suitable for storing in a relational database for re-use at a later time,
i.e., time, date, city and country of caption, plus relevant user interaction metadata
such as number and IDs of friends who viewed, commented, or liked the picture.
The concept-based annotation represents the core of the module as it allows Sen-
tic Album to go beyond a mere syntactic analysis of the metadata associated with
pictures. A big problem of manual image annotation, in fact, is the different vocab-
ulary that different users (or even the same user) can use to describe the content of
a picture. The different expertise and purposes of tagging users, in fact, may result
in tags that use various levels of abstraction to describe a resource: a photo can be
tagged at the ‘basic level’ of abstraction [161] as ‘cat’, or at a superordinate level
as ‘animal’, or at various subordinate levels below the basic level as ‘Persian cat’ or
‘Felis silvestris catus longhair Persian’.
To overcome this problem, Sentic Album extends the set of available tags with
related semantics and sentics and, to further expand the cognitive and affective meta-
data associated with each picture, it extracts additional common-sense and affective
concepts from its description and comments. In particular, the conceptual meta-
data is processed by the opinion mining engine (Fig. 5.5). The IsaCore sub-module,
specifically, finds matches between the retrieved concepts and those previously cal-
culated using CF-IOF and spectral association. CF-IOF weighting is exploited to
find seed concepts for a set of a-priori categories, extracted from Picasa 13 popular
tags, meant to cover common topics in personal pictures, e.g., art, nature, friends,
travel, wedding, or holiday. Spectral association is then used to expand this set with
semantically related common-sense concepts. The retrieved concepts are also pro-
cessed by the AffectiveSpace sub-module, which projects them into the vector space
representation of AffectNet, clustered by means of Sentic Medoids, in order to infer
the affective valence and the polarity associated with them.
Providing a satisfactory visual experience is one of the main goals for present-
day electronic multimedia devices. All the enabling technologies for storage, trans-
mission, compression, and rendering should preserve, and possibly enhance, image
quality; and to do so, quality control mechanisms are required. Systems to automat-
ically assess visual quality are generally known as objective quality metrics. The
design of objective quality metrics is a complex task because predictions must be
consistent with human visual quality preferences.
Human preferences are inherently quite variable and, by definition, subjective;
moreover, in the field of visual quality, they stem from perceptual mechanisms that
are not fully understood yet. A common choice is to design metrics that replicate
the functioning of the human visual system (HVS) to a certain extent, or at least that
take into account its perceptual response to visual distortions by means of numerical
features [152]. Although successful, these approaches come with a considerable
computational cost, which makes them impractical for most real-time applications.
Computational intelligence paradigms allow to tackle the quality assessment task
from a different perspective, since they aim at mimicking quality perception instead
of designing an explicit model of the HVS [207, 182, 238].
In the special case of personal pictures, perceived quality metrics can be com-
puted not only at content level, but also at concept and context level. One of the
primary reasons why people take pictures is to remember the emotions they felt on
special occasions of their lives. Extracting and storing such affective information
can be a key factor in improving future searches, as users seldom want to find pho-
tos matching general requirements. Users’ criteria in browsing personal pictures,
in fact, are more often related to the presence of a particular person in the picture
and/or its perceived quality (e.g., to find a good photo of your mother). Satisfying
this type of requirement is a tedious task as chronological ordering or classification
by event does not help much. The process usually involves repeatedly trying to think
of a matching picture and then looking for it. An exhaustive search (looking through
the whole collection for all of the photos matching a requirement) would normally
only be carried out in exceptional circumstances, such as following a death in the
family. In order to accordingly rank personal photos, Sentic Album exploits data and
metadata associated with them to extract useful information at content, concept, and
context level and, hence, calculate the perceived quality of online pictures (PQOP):
PQOP(p, u) = 3
Content(p) <-(simbolo estranho)Concept(p, u) <-(simbolo estranho)Context(p, u)
Content(p) +Concept(p, u) +Context(p, u)
(5.3)
where Content, Concept, and Context (3Cs) are float 2 [0,1] representing image
quality assessment values associated with picture p and user u, in terms of visual,
conceptual, and contextual information, respectively. In particular, Content(p) is
computed from numerical features extracted through a reduced-reference frame-
work for objective quality assessment based on extreme learning machine [91] and
the colour correlogram [142] of p; Concept(p, u) specifies how much the picture
p is relevant to the user u in terms of cognitive and affective information; finally,
Context(p, u) defines the degree of relevance of picture p for user u in terms of
time, location, and user interaction. The 3Cs are all equally relevant for measuring
how good a personal picture is to the eye of a user. According to the formula, in
fact, if any of the 3Cs is null the PQOP is null as well, even though the remain-
ing elements of the 3Cs have both maximum values, e.g., a perfect quality picture
(Content(p) = 1) taken in the hometown of the user on the date of his birthday
(Context(p, u) = 1), but depicting people he/she does not know and objects/places
that are totally irrelevant for him/her (Concept(p, u) = 0).
The Storage Module is the middle-tier in which the outputs of the Annotation
Module are stored, in a way that these can be easily accessible by the Search and
Retrieval Module at a later time. The module stores information relative to photo
data and metadata redundantly at three levels:
1. in a relational database fashion
2. in a Semantic Web format
3. in a matrix format
Sentic Album stores information in three main SQL databases (Fig. 5.6), that
is a Content DB, for the information relative to data (image statistics), a Concept
DB, for the information relative to conceptual metadata (semantics and sentics),
and a Context DB, for the information relative to contextual metadata (timestamp,
geolocation, and user interaction metadata).
The Concept DB, in particular, consists of two databases, the Semantic DB and
the Sentic DB, in which the cognitive and affective information associated with
photo metadata are stored, respectively. The Context DB, in turn, is divided into
four databases: the Calendar, Geo, FOAF (Friend Of A Friend), and Interaction
DBs, which contain the information relative to timestamp, geolocation, social links,
and social interaction, respectively. These databases are also integrated with infor-
mation coming from the web profile of the user such as user’s DOB (for the Cal-
endar DB), user’s current location (for the Geo DB), or user’s list of friends (for
the FOAF DB). The FOAF DB, in particular, plays an important role within the
Context DB since it provides the other peer databases with information relative to
user’s social connections, e.g., relatives’ birthdays or friends’ location. Moreover,
the Context DB receives extra contextual information from the inferred semantics.
Personal names in the conceptual metadata are recognised by building a dictionary
of first names from the Web and combining them with regular expressions to recog-
nise full names. These are added to the database (in the FOAF DB) together with
geographical places (in the Geo DB), which are also mined from databases on the
Web and added to the parser’s semantic lexicon.
As for the Semantic Web format [168], all the information related to pictures’
metadata is stored in RDF/XML according to a set of predefined web ontologies.
This operation aims to make the description of the semantics and sentics associated
with pictures applicable to most online images coming from different sources, e.g.,
online photo sharing services, blogs, and social networks. To further this aim, it
is necessary to standardise as much as possible the descriptors used in encoding
the information about multimedia resources and people to which the images refer,
in order to make it univocally interpretable and suitable to feed other applications.
Hence, the ensemble of HEO, OMR, FOAF, and WNA is used again.
As for the storage of photo data and metadata in a matrix format, a dataset, termed
‘3CNet’, is built, which integrates the information from the 3Cs in a unique knowl-
edge base. The aim of this representation is to exploit principal component analysis
(PCA) to later organise online personal images in a multi-dimensional vector space
(as for AffectiveSpace) and, hence, reason on their similarity. 3CNet, in fact, is an
n ->(simbolo estranho) m matrix whose rows are user’s personal pictures IDs, whose columns are either
content, concept, and context features (e.g., ‘contains cold colours’, ‘conveys joy’ or
‘located in Italy’), and whose values indicate truth values of assertions. Therefore,
in 3CNet, each image is represented by a vector in the space of possible features
whose values are +1, for features that produce an assertion of positive valence, -1,
for features that produce an assertion of negative valence, and 0 when nothing is
known about the assertion.
The degree of similarity between two images, then, is the dot product between
their rows in 3CNet. The value of such a dot product increases whenever two im-
ages are described with the same feature and decreases when they are described by
features that are negations of each other. The main aim of the Search and Retrieval
Module is to provide users with an IUI that allows them to easily manage, search,
and retrieve their personal pictures online (Fig. 5.7).
Most of the existing photo management systems let users search for pictures
through a keyword-based query, but results are hardly ever good enough since it is
very difficult to come up with an ideal query from the user’s initial request. The
initial idea of an image the user has in mind before starting a search session, in fact,
often deviates from the final results he/she will choose [289]. In order to let users
start from a sketchy idea and then dynamically refine their search, the multi-faceted
classification paradigm is adopted.
Personal images are displayed in a dynamic gallery that can be ordered according
to different parameters, either textual or numeric, that is visual features (e.g., colour
balance, hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast), semantics (i.e., common-sense
concepts such as ‘go jogging’ and ‘birthday party’, but also people and objects con-
tained in the picture), sentics (i.e., emotions conveyed by the picture and its polarity)
and contextual information (e.g., time of caption, location, and social information
such as users who viewed/commented on the picture).
In particular, NLP techniques similar to those used to process the image concep-
tual metadata are employed to analyse the text typed in the search box and, hence,
perform queries on the SQL databases of the Storage Module. The order of visuali-
sation of the retrieved images is given by the PQOP, so that images containing more
relevant information at content, concept, and context level are first displayed. If, for
example, the user is looking for pictures of his/her partner, Sentic Album initially
proposes photos representing important events such as first date, first childbirth or
honeymoon, that is, pictures with high PQOP.

Storage Module’s 3CNet is also exploited in the IUI, in order to find similar
pictures. Towards the end of a search, the user sometimes may be interested in find-
ing pictures similar to one of those so far obtained, even if this does not fulfill the
constraints currently set via the facets. To serve this purpose, every picture is pro-
vided with a ‘like me’ button that opens a new Exhibit window displaying content,
concept, and context related images, independently of any constraint.
Picture similarity is calculated by means of PCA and, in particular, through
TSVD, as for AffectiveSpace. The number of singular values to be discarded (in
order to reduce the dimensionality of 3CNet and, hence, reason on picture similar-
ity) is chosen according to the total number of user’s online personal pictures and
the amount of available metadata associated with them, i.e., according to size and
density of 3CNet. Thus, by exploiting the information sharing property of TSVD,
images specified by similar content, concept, and context are likely to have similar
features and, hence, tend to fall near each other in the built-in vector space. Finally,
the IUI also offers to display images according to date of caption on a timeline.
Chronology, in fact, is a key categorisation concept for the management of personal
pictures. Having the collection in chronological order is helpful for locating partic-
ular photos or events, since it is usually easier to remember when an event occurred
relative to other events, as opposed to remembering its absolute date and time [164].
Many works dealing with object detection, scene categorisation, or content anal-
ysis on the cognitive level have been published, trying to bridge the semantic gap
between represented objects and high-level concepts associated with them [172].
However, where affective retrieval and classification of digital media is concerned,
publications, and especially benchmarks, are very few [186]. To overcome the lack
of availability of relevant datasets, the performance and the user-friendliness of Sen-
tic Album were tested on a topic and mood tagged evaluation dataset and through a
usability test on a pool of 18 Picasa regular users, respectively.
For the system performance testing, in particular, 1,000 LiveJournal posts with
labels matching Picasa tags such as ‘friends’, ‘travel’, and ‘holiday’, were selected
in order to collect natural language text that is likely to have the same semantics as
the conceptual metadata typical of personal photos. The classification test, hence,
concurrently estimated the capacity of the system to infer both the cognitive and
affective information (topic and mood tags, respectively) usually associated with
online personal pictures (Table 5.3).
For the usability test, users were asked to freely browse their online personal
collections using Sentic Album IUI and to retrieve particular sets of pictures, in
order to judge both usability and accuracy of the interface. Common queries in-
cluded “find a funny picture of your best friend”, “search for the shots of your last
summer holiday”, “retrieve pictures of you with animals”, “find an image taken on
Christmas 2009”, “search for pictures of you laughing”, and “find a good picture
of your mom”. From the test, it emerged that users really appreciate being able to
dynamically and quickly set/remove constraints in order to display specific batches
of pictures (which they cannot do in Picasa).
After the test session, participants were asked to fill-in an online questionnaire in
which they were asked to rate, on a five-level scale, each single functionality of the
interface according to their perceived utility. Concept facets and timeline, in partic-
ular, were found to be the most used by participants for search and retrieval tasks
(Table 5.4). Users also really appreciated the ‘like me’ functionality, which was gen-
erally able to propose very relevant (semantically and affectively related) pictures
(again not available in Picasa). When freely browsing their collections, users were
particularly amused by the ability to navigate their personal pictures according to
the emotion these conveyed, even though they did not always agree with the results.
Additionally, participants were not very happy with the accuracy of the search
box, especially if they searched for one particular photo out of the entire collection.
However, they always very much appreciated the order in which the pictures were
proposed, which allowed them to quickly have all the most relevant pictures avail-
able as first results. 83.3% of test users declared that, despite not being as nifty as
Picasa, Sentic Album is a very good photo management tool (especially for its novel
semantic faceted search and PQOP functionalities) and they hope they could still be
using it because, in the end, what really counts when browsing personal pictures is
to find good matches in the shortest amount of time.

Development of HCI Systems


Human computer intelligent interaction is an emerging field aimed at providing nat-
ural ways for humans to use computers as aids. It is argued that, for a computer to be
able to interact with humans, it needs to have the communication skills of humans.
One of these skills is the affective aspect of communication, which is recognised to
be a crucial part of human intelligence and has been argued to be more fundamental
in human behaviour and success in social life than intellect [292, 221]. Emotions
influence cognition and, therefore, intelligence, especially when it involves social
decision-making and interaction.
The latest scientific findings indicate that emotions play an essential role in
decision-making, perception, learning, and more. Most of the past research on af-
fect sensing has considered each sense such as vision, hearing, and touch in isola-
tion. However, natural human-human interaction is multi-modal: we communicate
through speech and use body language (posture, facial expressions, gaze) to express
emotion, mood, attitude, and attention. To this end, a novel fusion methodology
is proposed, which is able to fuse any number of unimodal categorical modules,
with very different time-scales, output labels, and recognition success rates, in a
simple and scalable way. In particular, such a methodology is exploited to fuse the
outputs of the opinion mining engine with the ones of a facial expression analyser
for designing an embodied conversational agent with affective common-sense (sec-
tion 5.2.1). This section, moreover, illustrates how the engine can be exploited for
the development of HCI applications in fields such as instant messaging (IM) (sec-
tion 5.2.2) and multimedia management (section 5.2.3).

Sentic Chat


Online communication is an extremely popular form of social interaction. Unlike
face-to-face communication, online IM tools are extremely limited in conveying
emotions or the context associated with a communication. Users have adapted to this
environment by inventing their own vocabulary, e.g., by putting actions within aster-
isks (“I just came from a shower *shivering*”), or by using emoticons, by addressing
a particular user in a group communication (“@Ravi”). Such evolving workarounds
clearly indicate a latent need for a richer, more immersive user experience in social
communication. This problem is addressed by exploiting the semantics and sentics
associated with the on-going communication to develop an adaptive user interface
(UI) capable to change according to content and context of the online chat. Popular
approaches to enhance and personalise computer-mediated communication (CMC)
include emoticons, skins, avatars, and customisable status messages.
However, all these approaches require explicit user configuration or action: the
user needs to select the emoticon, status-message, or avatar that best represents
him/her. Furthermore, most of these enhancements are static - once selected by the
user, they do not adapt themselves automatically. There is some related work on au-
tomatically updating the status of the user by analysing various sensor data available
on mobile devices [196].

Sentic Corner

In a world in which web users are continuously blasted by ads and often compelled
to deal with user-unfriendly interfaces, we sometimes feel like we want to evade
from the sensory overload of standard web pages and take refuge in a safe web cor-
ner, in which contents and design are in harmony with our current frame of mind.
Sentic Corner [47] is an IUI that dynamically collects audio, video, images, and
text related to the user’s current feelings and activities as an interconnected knowl-
edge base, which is browsable through a multi-faceted classification website. In
the new realm of Web 2.0 applications, the analysis of emotions has undergone
a large number of interpretations and visualisations, e.g., We Feel Fine 15 , Mood-
View 16 , MoodStats 17 , and MoodStream 18 , which have often led to the development
of emotion-sensitive systems and applications.
Nonetheless, today web users still have to almost continuously deal with sensory-
overloaded web pages, pop-up windows, annoying ads, user-unfriendly interfaces,
etc. Moreover, even for websites uncontaminated by web spam, the affective con-
tent of the page is often totally unsynchronised with the user’s emotional state. Web
pages containing multimedia information inevitably carry more than just informa-
tive content. Behind every multimedia content, in fact, there is always an emotion.

Development of E-Health Systems


In health-care, it has long been recognised that, although the health professional
is the expert in diagnosing, offering help, and giving support in managing a clin-
ical condition, the patient is the expert in living with that condition. Health-care
providers need to be validated by somebody outside the medical departments but, at
the same time, inside the health-care system. The best candidate for this is not the
doctor, the nurse, or the therapist, but the real end-user of health-care – none other
than the patient him/herself.
Patient 2.0 is central to understanding the effectiveness and efficiency of services
and how they can be improved. The patient is not just a consumer of the health-
care system but a quality control manager – his/her opinions are not just reviews of
a product/service but more like small donations of experience, digital gifts which,
once given, can be shared, copied, moved around the world, and directed to just
the right people who can use them to improve health-care locally, regionally, or
nationally. Web 2.0 dropped the cost of voice, of finding others ‘like me’, of forming
groups, of obtaining and republishing information, to zero. As a result, it becomes
easy and rewarding for patients and carers to share their personal experiences with
the health-care system and to research conditions and treatments.

Crowd Validation


As Web 2.0 dramatically reduced the cost of communication, today it is easy and
rewarding for patients and carers to share their personal experiences with the health-
care system. This social information, however, is often stored in natural language
text and, hence, intrinsically unstructured, which makes comparison with the struc-
tured information supplied by health-care providers very difficult. To bridge the gap
between these data, which though different at structure-level are similar at concept-
level, a patient opinion mining tool has been proposed to provide the end-users of
the health system with a common framework to compare, validate, and select their
health-care providers.
In order to give structure to online patient opinions, both the semantics and sen-
tics associated with these are extracted in a way that it is possible to map them to
the fixed structure of health-care data. This kind of data, in fact, usually consists of
ratings that associate a polarity value to specific features of health-care providers
such as communication, food, parking, service, staff, and timeliness. The polarity
can be either a number in a fixed range or simply a flag (positive/negative). In the
proposed approach, structure is added to unstructured data by building semantics
and sentics on top of it (Fig. 5.14).

topics T with different polarity p 2 [ 1, 1], the subset of opinions o check(simbolo estranho) O is extracted,
for each t 2 T , and p is determined for each o. In other words, since each opinion
can regard more than one topic and the polarity values associated with each topic
are often independent from each other, a set of topics is extracted from each opinion
and then, for each topic detected, the polarity associated with it is inferred. Once
natural language data are converted to a structured format, each topic expressed in
each patient opinion and its related polarity can be aggregated and compared. These
can then be easily assimilated with structured health-care information contained in
a database or available through an API.
This process is termed crowd validation [51] (Fig. 5.15), because of the feed-
back coming from the masses, and it fosters next-generation health-care systems, in
which patient opinions are crucial in understanding the effectiveness and efficiency
of health services and how they can be improved. Within this work, in particular,
the opinion mining engine is used to marshal PatientOpinion’s social information in
a machine-accessible and machine-processable format and, hence, compare it with
the official hospital ratings provided by NHS Choices 22 and each NHS trust. The
inferred ratings are used to validate the information declared by the relevant health-
care providers (crawled separately from each NHS trust website) and the official
NHS ranks (extracted using NHS Choices API). At the present time, crowd valida-
tion cannot be directly tested because of the impossibility to objectively assess the
truthfulness of both patient opinions and official NHS ratings.

Given that the patient opinion mining performance of the system has already
been tested (Table 4.7), however, an experimental investigation has been performed
over a set of 200 patient opinions about three different NHS trusts, for which self-
assessed ratings were crawled from each hospital website and official NHS ranks
were obtained through NHS Choices API. Results showed an average discrepancy
of 39% between official and unofficial ratings, which sounds plausible as, according
to Panorama 23 , 60% of hospitals inspected in 2010 gave inaccurate information to
the government in assessing their own performance.



Conclusion
**********

The textual information available on the Web can be broadly grouped into two
main categories: facts and opinions. Facts are objective expressions about entities
or events. Opinions are usually subjective expressions that describe people’s sen-
timents, appraisals, or feelings towards such entities and events. Much of the ex-
isting research on textual information processing has been focused on mining and
retrieval of factual information, e.g., text classification [271], text recognition [294],
text clustering [171], and many other text mining and NLP tasks. Little work had
been done on the processing of opinions until only recently [179].
One of the main reasons for the lack of study on opinions is the fact that there
was little opinionated text available before the recent passage from a read-only to a
read-write Web. Before that, in fact, when people needed to make a decision, they
typically asked for opinions from friends and family. Similarly, when organisations
wanted to find the opinions or sentiments of the general public about their prod-
ucts and services, they had to specifically ask people by conducting opinion polls
and surveys. However, with the advent of the Social Web, the way people express
their views and opinions has dramatically changed. They can now post reviews of
products at merchant sites and express their views on almost anything in Internet
forums, discussion groups, and blogs. Such online word-of-mouth behaviour repre-
sents new and measurable sources of information with many practical applications.
However, finding opinion sources and monitoring them can be a formidable task
because there are a large number of diverse sources and each source may also have
a huge volume of opinionated text. In many cases, in fact, opinions are hidden in
long forum posts and blogs. It is extremely time consuming for a human reader to
find relevant sources, extract related sentences with opinions, read them, summarise
them, and organise them into usable forms. Thus, automated opinion discovery and
summarisation systems are needed.
Sentiment analysis grows out of this need. It is a very challenging NLP or text
mining problem. Due to its tremendous value for practical applications, there has
been an explosive growth of both research in academia and applications in the in-
dustry. All the sentiment analysis tasks, however, are very challenging. Our under-
standing and knowledge of the problem and its solution are still limited. The main
reason is that it is a NLP task, and NLP has no easy problems. Another reason
may be due to our popular ways of doing research. So far, in fact, researchers have
probably relied too much on machine learning algorithms. Some of the most effec-
tive machine learning algorithms, in fact, produce no human understandable results
such that, although they may achieve improved accuracy, little about how and why
is known, apart from some superficial knowledge gained in the manual feature en-
gineering process. All such approaches, moreover, rely on syntactical structure of
text, which is far from the way human mind processes natural language.
In this book, common-sense computing techniques were further developed and
applied to bridge the semantic gap between word-level natural language data and the
concept-level opinions conveyed by these. In particular, the ensemble application
of graph mining and multi-dimensionality reduction techniques was exploited on6.3 Conclusions

two common-sense knowledge bases to develop a novel intelligent engine for open-
domain opinion mining and sentiment analysis. The proposed approach, termed sen-
tic computing, performs a clause-level semantic analysis of text, which allows the
inference of both the conceptual and emotional information associated with natural
language opinions and, hence, a more efficient passage from (unstructured) textual
information to (structured) machine-processable data.
Blending scientific theories of emotion with the practical engineering goals of
analysing sentiments in natural language text and developing affect-sensitive inter-
faces is one of the main contributions of this book. Differently from most currently
available opinion mining services, in fact, the developed engine does not base its
analysis on a limited set of affect words and their co-occurrence frequencies, but
rather on common-sense concepts and the cognitive and affective valence conveyed
by these. This allows the engine to be domain-independent and, hence, to be embed-
ded in any sentiment analysis system for the development of intelligent applications
in multiple fields such as Social Web, HCI, and e-health.
Looking ahead, the combined novel use of different knowledge bases and of af-
fective common-sense reasoning techniques for opinion mining proposed in this
work will, eventually, pave the way for development of more bio-inspired ap-
proaches to the design of intelligent systems capable of handling knowledge, mak-
ing analogies, learning from experience, perceiving, and expressing affect. The
question, in fact, is not whether intelligent machines can ha

These semantic relationships are what we call common-sense knowledge and consist in knowing that people are younger than their parents, that a butcher is unlikely to be a vegetarian, that people do not like being repeatedly interrupted, that if you hold a knife by its blade then it may cut you, that if you drop paper into a flame then it will burn, that people pay taxi drivers to drive them to places, that people generally sleep at night, and so forth. Computers do not know such things, as they never had the opportunity to live a life and to experience or be taught the meaning of words, objects, and actions, and how these relate to each other. If we want machines to really understand natural language, hence, we need to provide them with such knowledge.
